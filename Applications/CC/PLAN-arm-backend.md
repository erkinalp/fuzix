# The Thumb backend, incrementally — rung 3 working plan

2026-07-30.  Decision taken: skip rung 2 (load-time translation) and go
straight to a real cc2 Thumb backend in mixed mode.  Rationale in
PLAN-native-backend.md; this is the execution plan.  The ladder doc's
job was "is this feasible in increments"; this doc's job is "what is
the next commit".

## The shape of the thing

One new file, `backend-thumb.c`, cloned from `backend-bcode.c` and
sharing everything except the code bytes: same object format (FBC1),
same data/literal segments, same symbols, fixups, labels and backpatch
machinery, same gen_* API driven by the same backend.c tree walker.
cc1 is untouched — target-thumb.c already models the ARM types.

Mixed mode is the increment mechanism: the emitter compiles a function
natively only if it meets the current coverage list, otherwise
re-emits it as bytecode.  Both kinds live in one object's code
segment; interpreted and native functions call each other freely.
Coverage widens one construct at a time, and at every point in between
the whole test suite runs and passes.

Native code keeps the interpreter's machine model deliberately:

* the VM stack in mem[] stays the stack — args, locals, temporaries.
  Callers push args the same way whichever kind of function they call,
  which is what makes mixing free.  The real machine stack is used
  only for BL return addresses within native code.
* program addresses stay 32-bit offsets into mem[]; native code keeps
  the mem base in a register and addresses with `[base, offset]`.
* A stays the value home: returned in r0/r1 (low/high, doubles as
  bit patterns) exactly as the interpreter's A.
* anything not yet inlined is a BL into a helper — and the helpers are
  the interpreter's own case bodies, extracted.  So the first native
  function body is correct by construction, and speed comes from
  replacing helper calls with inline Thumb, one opcode at a time.
  (This is rung 2's one good idea, relocated to compile time where the
  branch-remapping problem disappears — cc2 already has labels and
  fixups.)

Register plan (fixed for the life of the design, so helpers and
emitted code agree):

	r0/r1	A (value / value:high), scratch, arg to helpers
	r2/r3	scratch
	r4	vsp — the VM stack pointer, as a native pointer
	r5	helper vector base
	r6	mem[] base
	r7	scratch / future use
	sp	real machine stack: BL frames only

r4–r6 are callee-saved in AAPCS, so helpers written in C preserve
them for free.  vsp lives in a register as a native pointer, not an
offset, because it is touched constantly; it is written back to the
interpreter's `sp` (offset form) only at the boundaries.

## The seam: how the two worlds call each other

The frame layout is identical for both kinds of callee — that is the
whole trick.  A caller (either kind) pushes args on the VM stack, then
one slot for the return-pc, then transfers control.  A bytecode callee
BC_RETs through that slot; a native callee ignores it and its
trampoline pops it.  Offsets baked into BC_LOCAL / native equivalents
are the same either way.

Function entry gets a marker: the first code byte of a native function
is a new pseudo-op, `BC_NATIVE` (0xF0), followed by padding to 2-byte
alignment, then Thumb code.  Dispatch is then one byte-test:

* **bytecode calls X**: BC_CALL/BC_CALLA look at `code[X]`.  Marker
  absent: push pc, jump — exactly today.  Marker present: push the
  sentinel into the return-pc slot, load the register file (vsp, mem
  base, helper base), BLX into the Thumb entry, write A back, pop the
  slot, continue at the next bytecode.
* **native calls X**: every call site BLs a `call_target` trampoline
  with X in r0.  Marker present: tail-call it.  Absent: save pc, push
  sentinel, run the interpreter loop until it hits the sentinel RET
  (the existing 0xFFFFFFFF mechanism — made re-entrant by saving and
  restoring the loop's pc), restore, return with A.

Uniform indirection at every native call site costs a few cycles and
buys total freedom over which functions are native — no fixup
distinguishes the cases, and the emitter never needs to know what a
callee compiled to (it may not have seen it yet).  Direct BL between
known-native pairs is a stage-8 peephole, not a design requirement.

Helpers get no per-site fixups either: the loader fills a word table
(helper vector, base in r5) and native code does
`ldr r3, [r5, #idx*4]; blx r3`.  BC_LIBCALL from native code is the
same thing via a `native_libcall(idx)` helper, so printf, libm and the
mm runtime need nothing new.

Object format: unchanged except the marker byte inside code, and
`h_pad` becomes `h_flags` with bit 0 = "contains native code", so an
old interpreter rejects a mixed object at load with a clear message
instead of faulting on 0xF0 mid-run.

## Instruction-set notes (decided up front, so they never surprise)

* Thumb-2 as ARMv7-M: everything ARMv8-M mainline (M33) executes, and
  it also runs under qemu-arm on any Cortex-A.  No FPU instructions
  ever — doubles go through helpers, where the real work (aeabi
  soft-float inside bcrun) already happens; that is why the eclipse
  only stands to gain ~12% from floats but far more from dispatch.
* Constants via movw/movt, never literal pools — no pool placement,
  no 4-byte alignment islands, no pc-relative loads to get wrong.
* All code 2-byte aligned; BLX targets carry bit 0 (Thumb bit).
* Bounds checking: native loads/stores do not bounds-check (the
  interpreter's rd/wr do).  This is the one semantic divergence;
  the differential harness compares *output*, not faults, and a debug
  build can route loads/stores through helpers to restore checking.

## Stages

Each stage ends green: conformance suite + mmb2c suite, differential
where applicable, before the next begins.

**Stage 0 — prerequisite, independent: mm runtime into bcrun.**
Phase 1's outstanding move (mmb2c repo, fcc/PLAN-fuzix.md): the mm_*
runtime becomes native libcalls, translated programs shrink ~93K→~20K.
Wanted regardless, and it means the backend only ever compiles *user*
code — the runtime never round-trips through Thumb emission.

**Stage 1 — harness before backend.**  A `Makefile.qemu` building
bcrun with arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc (static, -marm/-mthumb irrelevant
for bcrun itself; what matters is that emitted Thumb-2 runs in the
process) and a differential runner: every .bc executed under native
bcrun (host reference) and qemu bcrun, stdout byte-compared.  Run the
whole existing suite through it *interpreted* first — proves the
harness with zero new code in the loop.  (The Fuzix cross build can't
run under qemu-arm — Linux user emulation supplies Linux syscalls —
hence a third bcrun build.  Board remains the final gate.)
Setup, checked 2026-07-30: arm-none-eabi-as/objdump are present in
WSL; `qemu-user` and `gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf` are not — one apt
install before stage 1 starts.

**Stage 2 — the seam, with no native code yet.**  BC_NATIVE defined;
h_flags; `bc_exec()` made re-entrant (save/restore pc); call dispatch
factored so BC_CALL/BC_CALLA go through one `call_target` path.  No
emitter changes; the marker is never generated.  Everything still
passes — this stage is pure refactor and lands first because it
touches the interpreter, which is trusted and tested.

**Stage 3 — one hand-written native function.**  Before cc2 learns
anything: hand-assemble (`arm-none-eabi-as` or a 20-line Python
encoder) the body of `int add2(int a, int b)` reading args off the VM
stack per the frame layout, patch it into a .bc by hand, run it under
qemu and *on the board*.  ~50 lines total, and it retires every real
unknown at once: the register file, the trampolines both directions,
frame-slot arithmetic, executable-RAM on Fuzix (checks any MPU
surprise), bit-0 interworking.  If anything about the design is wrong,
it is wrong here, cheaply.

**Stage 4 — backend-thumb.c v1: integer leaf functions.**  Clone
backend-bcode.c; emit per-function into a side buffer; if the function
trips anything outside coverage, throw the buffer away and re-emit
bytecode (the bcode emitter is cheap; per-function two-pass is fine).
v1 coverage — the integer core, each op a short inline sequence or a
helper BL, in this order, validating after each:

1. prologue/epilogue, BC_ENTER/LEAVE/RET equivalents, CONST via
   movw/movt, LOCAL addressing, PUSH/POP on vsp
2. LOAD/STORE at widths 1/2/4 (`ldrb/ldrsb/ldrh/ldrsh/ldr` + mem base)
3. add/sub/and/or/xor/shifts inline; mul inline; div/rem via helper
   (M33 has sdiv/udiv but the helper keeps v1 uniform)
4. compares materialising 0/1 (ite or branch pair), BOOL, jumps and
   conditional jumps to labels via the existing patch table
5. everything else — calls, 64-bit, floats, switch, struct copy,
   compound-assign helpers — trips the fallback

Exit: the integer subset of the conformance suite runs with those
functions native, differential-clean, and a loop-heavy microbenchmark
shows the expected multiple.

**Stage 5 — calls.**  Drop the leaf restriction: call sites become
`movw/movt r0, target-fixup; bl call_target`, BC_ARGS becomes an add
to vsp.  This is the stage where *most* real functions go native,
because BASIC-translated code is call-dense.

**Stage 6 — the wide types.**  64-bit ops (r0/r1 pairs where trivial —
add/sub/logic — helpers where not: mul/div/shifts); then the
double/float ops as pure helper BLs (BC_ADDD → `bl h_addd`); the
conversions likewise.  After this stage the eclipse compiles fully
native — first end-to-end timing against the 9.82 s interpreted mark.

**Stage 7 — the tail.**  BC_SWITCH (helper reusing the interpreter's
table walk), BC_COPY/BC_PUSHN (helper), the named compound-assign
libcalls, CALLA for function pointers.  Coverage list empties; the
bytecode fallback remains as the safety valve and the size lever.

**Stage 8 — measured peepholes, only now.**  In expected-value order:
compare+jfalse fusion (cmp + conditional branch, no 0/1
materialisation); constants folded into operands (add imm) via
gen_direct, which already presents them; redundant push/pop pairs
around sequential ops; direct BL for intra-module known-native
callees.  One peephole per commit, differential suite after each —
this is where a naive stack transcription usually goes subtly wrong,
so it waits until there is a trusted baseline to diff against.

**Stage 9 — the board proper.**  BIG_TABLES sizing for native output
(expect ~3–4× bytecode for covered code — CODEMAX and the on-board
cc2 limits need re-checking); a size policy for mixed mode (native
unless the code buffer would overflow, then largest-functions-first
back to bytecode); SD image refresh; eclipse timing.  Target from the
ladder doc: roughly 2–4 s.

## Baseline (2026-07-30, hosttest/bench.c)

The eclipse is deliberately NOT the yardstick: it lives in native
libm, so dispatch is a minority of its time (going native-runtime only
moved it 9.82 s → 9.19 s).  bench.c is what dispatch actually costs -
five phases, integer/call/memory bound, no float in any hot loop, each
printing a 32-bit checksum so every run is a differential test against
gcc -O2 as well as a timing.  Run both ways with hosttest/bench.sh;
the .bc is 3,387 bytes and travels to the board in two seconds.

| phase | host gcc -O2 | host bcrun | PC3 bcrun |
|---|---|---|---|
| sieve (8191×10)   | <1 ms | 67 ms  | 3.93 s |
| fib(27)           | <1 ms | 33 ms  | 2.69 s |
| shellsort (2000×5)| <1 ms | 52 ms  | 3.76 s |
| xorshift (200k)   | <1 ms | 184 ms | 8.30 s |
| byte-rev (4K×200) | <1 ms | 98 ms  | 6.94 s |

Board ≈ 45-82× the host interpreter, phase for phase.  These are the
numbers the backend is judged against: at the expected 3-8× for the
naive emitter, the board column lands around 0.5-2.5 s per phase, and
per-phase movement says which templates pay (rng = pure ALU, rev =
loads/stores, fib = call boundary, sieve/sort = mixed).

**Dhrystone 2.1** (netlib dhry-c in hosttest/dhry/, definitions
ANSI-fied for cc1 — it has no old-style parameter declarations — plus
a TIME_US microsecond clock and a fixed run count; bodies untouched,
output self-validates):

| build | Dhrystones/s |
|---|---|
| host gcc -O2 | 74,970,000 |
| host bcrun | 289,700 |
| **PC3 bcrun** | **3,800** (263 µs/run, ≈ 2.2 DMIPS) |

A native M33 at this clock is good for roughly 300-600k Dhrystones/s,
so the ceiling above the interpreter is ~100× on this workload; the
naive emitter's 3-8× leaves plenty for stage 8's peepholes to chase.
`bash hosttest/dhry/dhry.sh` rebuilds all three.

## Status

* **Stage 0 done** 2026-07-30: mm runtime native in bcrun (bcrun_mm.c),
  eclipse 9.19 s on the PC3, t6 dirs free, programs ~4.7× smaller.
* **Stage 1 done** 2026-07-30: Makefile.qemu + hosttest/qemudiff.sh,
  10/10 differential-pass including the eclipse.  The harness earned
  its keep immediately: an odd h_data put the whole bss segment - and
  its "aligned" int64 arrays - at an odd address (SIGBUS under qemu,
  silent on x86, latent on the board).  bssbase now rounds to 8 in the
  loader and mem[] itself carries aligned(8) instead of linker luck.
* **Stage 2 done** 2026-07-30: BC_NATIVE marker + version 2 objects
  (bytecode.h), unified call_target dispatch, re-entrant bc_exec,
  native_enter with the r4/r5/r6 register file.  All suites green,
  conformance still 165, bench times unchanged - the dispatch test
  costs nothing measurable.
* **Stage 3 done** 2026-07-30, on hardware: hand-written Thumb add2
  (hosttest/nat/) patched over its bytecode stub by natpatch.py, run
  through the real dispatch under qemu AND on the PC3 - plain sums
  where the stub shows +1000000, nested calls feeding native results
  to native args across the VM stack.  Executable RAM under Fuzix
  confirmed (no MPU surprise), Thumb bit right, frame parity right,
  x86 host refuses version-2 objects cleanly.  Eclipse regression
  clean at 9.08 s.

* **Stage 4 v1 done** 2026-07-30, checkpointed on hardware every few
  opcode groups (CP-A frame/const/jump/ret, CP-B stack/locals/loads/
  stores/addresses, CP-C 32-bit ALU + inlined compound-assign
  helpers, CP-D compares and conditional jumps - probes preserved in
  hosttest/thumb/, gate.sh runs all four, four-way agreement demanded:
  gcc -O2, host-alias, qemu-native, qemu-forced-bytecode).

  The design ended up better than planned: rather than a second tree
  walker, backend-thumb.c translates the function's just-emitted
  bytecode span at gen_epilogue - the bytecode is the single source
  of truth, labels are still symbolic, and bailing is free.  The
  BC_NATIVE marker carries a bytecode-alias field so mixed objects
  run on ANY host (x86 interprets the original span; BCRUN_BYTECODE=1
  forces it on ARM = free A/B).  Every i++ style compound assign,
  previously a named libcall, is inlined.

  **Hardware results, integer leaf functions (bench.c on the PC3,
  same binary A/B):**

  | phase | bytecode | native | speedup |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | sieve | 3847 ms | 50 ms | 77× |
  | shellsort | 3659 ms | 74 ms | 49× |
  | xorshift | 8176 ms | 60 ms | 136× |
  | byte-rev | 6757 ms | 118 ms | 57× |
  | fib(27) | 2644 ms | (bytecode: calls) | - |

  The "3-8×" estimate was off by an order of magnitude: the
  interpreter's bounds-checked byte-assembled memory path made board
  dispatch far more expensive than modelled, and these loops now run
  at essentially native M33 speed.  Conformance 165 throughout;
  fcctests 9/9; qemudiff 10/10 every checkpoint.

* **Stage 5 done** 2026-07-30 (CP-E): calls.  A native call site
  loads a trampoline from the helper vector, passes its vsp in r1,
  and BLXes; helper_call dispatches to native_enter for a native
  callee or a fresh bc_exec activation for a bytecode one - whose
  sentinel is also the frame-parity slot, so the layouts line up by
  construction.  BC_CALL targets travel through the literal pool with
  a flagged fixup (flag 1 = value slot): the loader must never
  mistake a pool word for a BC_CALL operand, and a target that
  resolves to a library symbol becomes a tagged index the trampoline
  turns back into a libcall.  General libcalls (printf, the mm
  runtime, libm) go through a second trampoline; the 64-bit/floating
  eqop names bail the function - they pop a slot inside C, which
  would desync the caller's r4.  Functions now save lr (push {lr} /
  pop {pc}).

  Two bugs found by the gates, both in dispatch plumbing, neither in
  emitted code: (1) after a native callee that itself makes calls,
  the global sp is whatever the deepest helper sync left it - the
  dispatcher must restore the slot level before popping (leaf
  callees, which every earlier checkpoint used, never touch it);
  (2) at -Os, gcc's IPA analysis looked straight through the asm
  "memory" clobber, decided native_enter never writes sp, and
  deleted the callers' restore - the board failed where the -O2 qemu
  build passed.  native_enter now preserves sp itself and declares
  sp/A/pc/mem as explicit "+m" asm operands.  The -Os/qemu repro
  (arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -Os) is the debugging path of record for
  any future board-only failure.

  **Hardware: fib(27) 2644 -> 382 ms (6.9×); Dhrystone 3,808 ->
  8,288/s (2.2×) with only 9 of 18 functions native** - struct
  assignment and switch (stages 6-7) block the rest, including the
  measurement loop's own Proc_1.  cpe probe: recursion, mutual
  recursion, function pointers through CALLA, printf from native
  code - all on the PC3.  The eclipse stays 0/34 native (every
  function touches doubles) until stage 6.

* **Stage 6 done** 2026-07-31, verified on hardware the same day.
  Groundwork first: the
  interpreter's sign-extended-A invariant was retired in favour of a
  **low-32 contract** - every 32-bit op reads only the low 32 bits of
  A (S32/U32 at compares, divides, shift counts, BOOL, JFALSE,
  SWITCH, load addresses, lib_eqop amounts) - because a native
  function returning a 32-bit value cannot cheaply maintain the old
  invariant in r1, and cc2 never tells the backend the return type.
  This also retired a latent stage-5 hazard (a native callee's int
  result compared/divided directly read garbage high bits).

  The ops: CONST64/LOAD64/STORE64/PUSH64/POP64/SEXT32/ZEXT32 inline
  as r0:r1 pairs; TRUNC64 emits nothing; add/sub/and/or/xor/neg/
  not64 as adds/adcs-style pairs; eq/ne64 by xor-orr; ordered 64-bit
  compares by subs/sbcs (subtract the other way round for gt/le - Z
  after sbcs is only the high word's).  Everything else goes through
  **helper_op** (vector slot 2): one C function running the
  interpreter's own case bodies with A in r2/r3 per the AAPCS, pure
  (reads the stacked operand through vsp, never moves the global sp;
  the call site adds the op's fixed pop count - 8/4/0 - to its own
  r4).  On the board those bodies are the DCP.  NEGD/NEGF inline as
  sign-bit flips; BOOLD/LNOTD/BOOLF/LNOTF are bit tests, per the
  rule below.  The fp/64 eqop bail is lifted via **helper_eqop**
  (slot 3) - the one libcall family that takes an input in A - with
  the fixed one-slot pop applied to r4 at the call site.

  **Literal pools are gone**: seven of the eclipse's eleven holdouts
  bailed on the 4KB LDR reach.  Loader-patched addresses are now
  movw/movt pairs under a pair fixup (f_pad flag 2) that decodes the
  scattered imm16s, adds the symbol (or stores the tagged lib
  index), re-encodes.  Old flag-1 pool objects still load.

  **Eclipse: 0/34 -> 33/34 native** (probes cpf/cpg join the 4-way
  gate; ctest 165, qemudiff 12/12, fcctests 9/9 throughout).
  f_moon - 31K of straight-line lunar series bytecode - translates
  to 117K and is excluded by a size policy (THUMB_MAXFN, default
  40000; THUMB_VERBOSE now names every bail).  Native expansion runs
  ~2.4-3.8x the bytecode.

  **The board fit problem, measured** (this is stage 9's brief):
  bcrun on the board is text 82.3K + data 0.4K + bss 54K (mem[] 48K)
  in a 260.6K process -> ~124K free for the loaded object.  The
  full-native eclipse is code 126.7K + sym 17.2K + fix 18.6K + str
  6.8K + libbind 4.3K = 172K.  Levers, in value order: (1) reclaim
  committed functions' dead bytecode by rewinding codelen and
  re-emitting in place - saves 22.7K here and shrinks every mixed
  object, but costs the bytecode alias (no BCRUN_BYTECODE A/B, no
  x86 host run), so it must be opt-in for board builds and main
  must stay bytecode (h_entry is interpreted); (2) stream fixups at
  load instead of malloc'ing fix[] - the file order needs two
  fseeks, saves 8 x nfix = 18.6K; (3) trim MEMSIZE or compact
  non-LIB symbols.  (1)+(2) lands ~127K - close; f_moon native
  (117K span) is unreachable on the board, ever.  Until then
  **THUMB_BUDGET** caps total native bytes first-come: the board
  eclipse ships at 19000 -> 73.8K code, 118.9K loaded, 7/34 native.

  Dhrystone: 10/18 native (Proc_1 waits on struct copy, Proc_6 and
  the Sw18 family on switch - stage 7 exactly as planned).

  **Board results 2026-07-31** (new bcrun+cc2 installed over
  serial): cpf and cpg byte-identical to the gcc reference on
  hardware; bench unchanged from stage 5 (sieve 51 / fib 385 /
  sort 77 / rng 60 / rev 123 ms, checksums good - the pair fixups
  and the low-32 contract cost nothing); Dhrystone 8,288 ->
  **8,421/s** at 10/18; the budgeted eclipse **loaded (118.9K,
  fit confirmed) and ran digit-identical: 7.11 s forced-bytecode ->
  6.39 s** with just 7/34 native, first-come.  The board hunt also
  caught a real libc gap the first time 64-bit values were printed
  on hardware: Fuzix vfprintf reads a long for "ll" and prints the
  low word of the 8-byte vararg - bcrun now formats 64-bit integer
  conversions itself on every host (one code path, one output;
  upstream issue material, Alan's TODO already lists 64-bit
  support).  The remaining eclipse gap is stage 9's: most functions
  are still interpreted only because the process ceiling excludes
  their native spans.

* **Stage 7 done** 2026-07-31, board-verified same day (CP-H).
  BC_SWITCH translates to a compare chain decoded entirely at
  translate time: the operand's fixup names the table symbol (in
  the literal segment), each entry's fixup names a case symbol
  whose value is a bytecode offset inside the current span - so
  native needs no table, no fixups, no runtime walk, and the dead
  bytecode keeps the operand fixup for the alias path.  BC_COPY /
  BC_PUSHN ride through helper_op with the length packed in the op
  word's high half (the only ops with an immediate); COPY's popped
  destination slot and PUSHN's rounded stack take are applied to r4
  at the call site.  natlist.py stops counting L<n>/Sw<n>_<n>
  generated symbols as functions - Dhrystone was 12 functions all
  along, and **all 12 are native now**.

  Probe cph.c (switch shapes incl. fallthrough, shared bodies,
  switch-in-loop, switch on a call result; struct assign/pass/
  return) - byte-identical on the board.  **Dhrystone, same binary
  A/B on the PC3: 3,912/s forced-bytecode -> 11,287/s native
  (2.9x; the interpreted-era baseline was 3,808)**.  That is ~29x
  off a native M33's ceiling, which is stage 8's territory: every
  call still crosses two trampolines and a C helper, and compares
  still materialise 0/1.

* **Stage 8 done** 2026-07-31 (a: direct BL, b: cmp+branch fusion;
  both board-verified same day).

  8a, two halves: at translate time a call to a callee already
  known native (itself, or anything committed earlier) emits
  subs r4,#4 / bl / adds r4,#4 - the parity slot is dead for a
  native callee, r4 comes back balanced, and t_base anchors the
  displacement.  Most calls are forward references, so at gen_end
  thumb_link_calls() rewrites every remaining trampoline site whose
  callee went native (recognised by its pair fixup + the exact
  14-byte movw/movt+tail pattern) into the same form plus three
  nops, in place, dropping the fixup.  **fib(27) 385 -> 78 ms**
  (2644 interpreted); the eclipse links 44 sites, Dhrystone 14.

  8b: every flag-materialise site fuses with a following JFALSE/
  JTRUE when nothing can land on the jump - branch on the flags,
  no 0/1, no second compare.  The && / || join labels (reached
  with A live) are excluded by their "L" tail - the one shape
  where fusion would be wrong, guarded by construction.  Board:
  sieve 47 ms, fib 71, sort 74, rng 57, rev 119 (all checksums
  good); Dhrystone 11,689/s; eclipse 6.36 s.

  **Cumulative vs the interpreter on the PC3: sieve 82x, fib 37x,
  sort 49x, rng 143x, rev 57x; Dhrystone 3.0x (string libcalls
  dominate what remains); eclipse 7.11 -> 6.36 s at only 7/34
  native.**  Remaining stage-8 candidates, unmeasured and parked:
  constants folded into operands via gen_direct, redundant
  push/pop pairs around sequential ops.

* **The native reference point** 2026-07-31 (hosttest/dhry/
  dhry-fuzix.sh + dhry_fuzix.c): Dhrystone cross-compiled by
  arm-none-eabi-gcc as an ordinary Fuzix application - same libc,
  same PICOIOC_ADVAL clock, shim printf for the %f the libc lacks.
  **On the PC3: 367,864/s at -Os, 379,022/s at -O2** (9.5K binary).
  That calibrated everything: we were 32x off, and the first thing
  the gap exposed was dispatch, not code generation - libbind only
  cached mm_* wrappers, so every strcpy walked ~30 strcmps of chain
  and every double += re-parsed its own name.  Binding everything
  once per symbol (fast table + mathbind + eqbind descriptors) took
  Dhrystone 11,689 -> **16,961/s** and the budgeted eclipse 6.36 ->
  **5.16 s**, runtime-only, same objects.  We stand at 22x off a
  real compiler; the rest is the software eval stack and the
  trampoline per still-unbound construct - stage-8-style work,
  measured, when it matters.

* **Stage 9 done** 2026-07-31, board-verified same day.  Three
  levers together closed the fit gap: streamed fixups (the loader
  applies records straight off the file - no fix[] malloc), dead-
  bytecode reclaim (THUMB_RECLAIM=1, opt-in: the native replacement
  lands where the bytecode was, alias gone, main kept interpreted;
  gate.sh grew a fifth way for it), and always-on symbol compaction
  at gen_end (unreferenced generated labels dropped, string table
  rebuilt, every reference renumbered - which meant owning the
  indices fixups do NOT carry: BC_LIBCALL operands and native
  movs/movw libcall immediates are recorded at emission, made
  absolute at commit, purged with reclaimed spans, and rewritten
  with the remap.  The eclipse shed 438 dead labels = 11.0K).

  **The full-native eclipse fits: 102.8K code, 119.0K loaded,
  33/34 native, no budget - and runs in 3.465 s on the PC3,
  digit-identical.**  The stage-9 target was 2-4 s.  The lineage
  on this hardware: MMBasic 12.5 s -> MicroPython 8.77 ->
  interpreted bcrun 9.19 -> DCP 7.16 -> stage 6 partial 6.39 ->
  libcall binding 5.16 -> **full native 3.465 s**.  f_moon stays
  interpreted forever (117K native span); the remaining distance
  to gcc is FP-helper overhead and f_moon itself.

Remaining, small: the SD image refresh with the new binaries; the
shebang trick so fcc output executes as ./prog (bcrun skipping a
leading #! line); the parked stage-8 peepholes (gen_direct constant
folding, push/pop pair elision) if a benchmark ever asks for them.

Stage 6 lessons, kept:
* BOOLD/LNOTD (and float forms) are BIT TESTS (pattern << 1 == 0),
  never real compares: the DCP flushes denormals - see "Floating
  point engines" below.
* Any libcall that pops VM stack inside C needs its pop count
  mirrored on the native caller's r4; any libcall that reads A needs
  A marshalled in r2/r3.  lib_eqop is the only family that does
  either - one slot, fixed - hence helper_eqop.

## Floating point engines (decided 2026-07-30, checked against the SDK)

The RP2040's boot-ROM float library does not exist on the RP2350: the
SDK's fast path there is double_aeabi_dcp.S - hand assembly for the
DCP, the double-precision coprocessor in the M33s - shipped in the
binary, nothing in ROM, nothing copied from ROM.  Our Fuzix userland
links the v8-m.main/nofp libgcc, so bcrun's doubles today are plain
soft-float in its own text.  64-bit integers involve no ROM or
coprocessor anywhere: inline adds/adcs/umull, libgcc __aeabi_ldivmod
for divide.

Stage 6 stays engine-agnostic - helper BLs remove the dispatch around
FP whatever implements the arithmetic.  The engine upgrade is a
SEPARATE work item benefiting interpreter and native equally: import
the SDK's DCP __aeabi_d* routines into bcrun (soft-ABI libm lowers
all its arithmetic to those symbols, so libm accelerates
transparently), plus the kernel side - CPACR enable and lazy
per-process DCP/FPU context save, mandatory now the port preempts.
MicroPython's 8.77 s eclipse already rides the DCP via the SDK; this
is the gap-closer.  The single-precision FPU (FPV5-SP) has the same
kernel prerequisite and much less value here: MMFLOAT is double, so
translated BASIC touches almost no single-precision.

**DONE 2026-07-30.**  Library/libs gains dcp_double.S and
dcp_conv_m33.S - the SDK's DCP aeabi routines and the pure-M33
64-bit conversions, regenerated verbatim by dcp-sync.sh under a
small local macro prelude (the __aeabi_l2d/ul2d/f2d set must come
too: libgcc bundles them in one object with dadd, so any unresolved
member drags all the soft doubles back in and collides).  These
override libgcc purely by link order, so EVERY userland relink gets
them - bbcbasic included.  Kernel: CPACR CP4 enable plus one RCMP to
clear the stale-at-reset engaged flag (miss that and the wrappers'
save path restores garbage state forever).  No context-switch save
needed: the SDK wrappers are self-saving against interrupted use.

**Results, PC3, all digit-identical to soft-float/host:** eclipse
9.19 s -> **7.16 s** (past MicroPython's 8.77, runtime still
interpreted bytecode); bbcbasic 1M-double-arith loop 15 s -> 9 s,
100k SIN*COS 3 s -> 2 s.

The hunt found a real latent compiler bug: cc2 emitted the
double-typed BOOL on the *integer* result of a double comparison.
Integer 1 read as a double is 5e-324 - a denormal - so exact
soft-float said "true" by accident for years, and the DCP, which
flushes denormals to zero, said "false": every compared condition in
every bytecode program died.  Fixed twice over: BOOLD/LNOTD (and the
float forms) in bcrun are now bit tests - identical IEEE semantics
including NaN and -0.0, denormal-exact on any engine - and the
backend's T_BOOL/T_BANG treat relational operands as the integers
they are (is_boolish).  Debugging path of record: soft-float relink
(ar d the dcp objects) bisects engine vs everything else in one run.

Known DCP limitation, accepted: genuinely denormal user values
compare as zero.  MMBasic arithmetic does not produce them in
practice; anything that cares can BCRUN_BYTECODE=1... no - can link
soft.  Documented here so nobody rediscovers it the hard way.

## Order of risk retirement

Stages 1–3 are small and kill the unknowns (harness fidelity,
re-entrancy, executable RAM, the ABI).  Stage 4 is the long grind but
each step is mechanical against backend-bcode.c open in the other
window.  Nothing after stage 3 should produce a surprise that isn't a
plain emitter bug, and every emitter bug is caught by a differential
run naming the first diverging output line.

## What is deliberately not here

No register allocation, no FPU use, no direct-threaded dispatch
improvements to the interpreter (rungs 1–2 declined), no attempt to
make native objects loadable by old bcruns.  And no board-side cc2
work until stage 9 — development runs host-side, qemu for execution,
the board for milestones.

## Stage 10: the peephole pass (designed 2026-07-31, profile-driven)

BCRUN_PROF proved the helper crossings are gone (v3): Dhrystone runs
4460 cycles/iter against gcc's 990 and nearly all of the difference
is the stack-machine shape - every operand round-trips through mem[]
where gcc keeps it in a register.  Subjects of record: dhrystone,
eclipse, benchmark.bas, KnivD bench.bas; board-measured; all gates
green after every stage.

Constraints discovered up front (violating any one is a wrong-code
bug the gates will catch, but design for them):
 - BC_LOCAL computes an address FROM r4.  A fusion that elides a
   push's memory traffic must still adjust r4 across any window
   containing LOCAL, or exclude LOCAL from windows.  Keeping the r4
   arithmetic (subs/adds #4) and eliding only the str/ldr is the
   safe default - the win is the memory traffic, not the adds.
 - r2/r3 die at every BL (helpers, DCP slots, calls).  A cached left
   operand lives in r2 (r2:r3 wide): windows must be call-free.
 - Branch targets invalidate all tracking.  The dry pass gains a
   target bitmap (TMAX/8 bytes, arena-carved on the board): every
   t_target seen during the dry walk sets a bit; the wet pass resets
   tracking state at every marked op and at every label/patch site.

Stages, each gated and board-measured before the next:
 10a  Infrastructure: target bitmap + a tiny tracking struct
      (what is in r2/r3, what address A mirrors) with a single
      invalidate() called at targets, calls, helper ops.
 10b  Store->load elision: STOREx addr via CONST32 leaves A intact;
      a following CONST32 same-addr + LOADx of the same width is a
      no-op.  Cross-statement, hits every "v = expr" followed by a
      use of v.  32-bit and 64-bit forms.
 10c  Push/op fusion, 32-bit: PUSH ; [r2-safe A-builder ops <= 4:
      CONSTx, LOCALx, LOADxx] ; binop  =>  keep r4 arithmetic, carry
      left in r2 (mov r2, r0), emit binop reg-to-reg.  Every binary
      expression in the program pays this pattern today.
 10d  Push/op fusion, 64-bit/double: left cached in r2:r3.  The DCP
      call wants left in r0:r1 - for commutative ops (ADDD MULD EQD
      NED, int ADD64 etc) call with swapped operands; for ordered
      ops either a 3-instr swap or parameterized load-to-r2:r3
      emitters for the builder ops (decide by measurement).
 10e  Re-measure, re-profile, decide whether DUP/SWAP/POP patterns
      and the DCP wrapper cost (self-save per call) are next.
