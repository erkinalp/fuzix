/*
 *	backend-thumb.c - the Thumb-2 side of mixed mode.
 *
 *	Included from the end of backend-bcode.c: one translation unit,
 *	because everything here works on the bytecode emitter's own
 *	tables - codebuf, the label and patch tables, symbols, fixups.
 *
 *	Strategy: the bytecode emitter runs unchanged for every function.
 *	At gen_epilogue the function's just-emitted bytecode span is
 *	translated opcode by opcode into Thumb-2; if every opcode in the
 *	span is covered, the native code is appended to the code segment
 *	behind a BC_NATIVE marker and the function's symbol is moved onto
 *	it, so every caller finds it through the ordinary fixup path.
 *	Anything uncovered just bails and the function stays bytecode -
 *	its span is already there.  The bytecode is fully explicit
 *	(widths, offsets, label references still symbolic in patchtab),
 *	which makes it a better translation source than a second tree
 *	walker that would have to agree with the first about every detail
 *	of stack tracking.
 *
 *	The dead bytecode of a committed function stays in the object:
 *	space, not correctness - nothing refers to it once the symbol
 *	moves.  h_entry never moves, so main always runs as bytecode;
 *	that costs nothing until calls go native in stage 5.  Reclaim is
 *	a later stage.
 *
 *	Register file (bytecode.h): r0/r1 = A, r4 = VM stack pointer as
 *	a native pointer, r5 = helper vector, r6 = mem[] base; r2/r3
 *	scratch.  Flags are dead between bytecode ops, so flag-setting
 *	16-bit forms are used freely.  Loader-patched addresses are
 *	movw/movt pairs under a dedicated pair fixup (flag 2) - the
 *	plain add-32-bit-symbol fixup cannot patch the scattered imm16
 *	fields.  (Stage 5 used a pc-relative literal pool instead; its
 *	4KB LDR reach turned out to be the binding limit on real
 *	functions - the eclipse's - so the loader learned the pair kind.)
 *
 *	Coverage grows checkpoint by checkpoint, each verified on the
 *	hardware (see PLAN-arm-backend.md):
 *	  CP-A  frame, constants, unconditional jumps, return
 *	  CP-B  stack ops, locals/args, loads and stores
 *	  CP-C  32-bit ALU, inline compound-assign helpers
 *	  CP-D  compares, conditional jumps, casts
 *	  CP-E  calls, libcalls (stage 5)
 *	  CP-F  64-bit values: moves and the cheap ALU pairs  (stage 6)
 *	  CP-G  floating point and helper-routed wide ops     (stage 6)
 *
 *	Stage 6 note: a native function returning a 32-bit value leaves
 *	r1 - A's high half - undefined; the interpreter's 32-bit ops read
 *	only the low 32 bits of A by contract, so this is fine, and
 *	64-bit consumers only ever see A after CONST64/LOAD64/POP64/
 *	SEXT32/ZEXT32 established the high word.
