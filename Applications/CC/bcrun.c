 *	AF_INET 1->2, SOCK_STREAM 3->1, SOCK_RAW 1->3, O_NDELAY
 *	16->O_NONBLOCK, F_GETFL/F_SETFL 0/1->host, IPPROTO_TLS
 *	254->plain TCP (TLS is the board kernel's), and the family
 *	field inside a sockaddr.  The layout itself is byte-identical
 *	(family u16 LE, port and address network order, 16 bytes), so
