 *	The mm_* BASIC runtime, native inside bcrun.

 *	Included from the end of bcrun.c so everything stays one
 *	translation unit: the wrappers need arg()/argd()/dput()/mem and
 *	the interpreter needs mm_wrap_lookup()/mmrt_reserve(), and none
 *	of it wants external linkage.
 *
 *	mmb_runtime.c and mmb_runtime.h are verbatim copies of the master
 *	files in Applications/mmb2c, compiled from there (-I../mmb2c).
 *	They used to be copies here, which drifted.
 *
 *	The scheme: the runtime's own code runs on native pointers,
 *	untouched.  Every entry point a translated program can call gets
 *	a small wrapper converting VM offsets to native pointers on the
 *	way in (mm_ptr) and back on the way out (mm_off).  The only state
 *	a program can hold a pointer to - the scratch-string pool and the
 *	by-ref pool - is carved out of VM memory by mmrt_reserve() and
 *	bound into the runtime, so those pointers are ordinary VM
 *	addresses.  Everything else (FILE channels, DATA cursors, GOSUB
 *	stack, INPUT line buffer) is native state the program only ever
 *	names, never addresses.
