 *	cc for the PC3 bytecode target.

 *	    cc prog.c            -> prog.bc, runnable with bcrun
 *	    cc -o name prog.c
 *	    cc -v prog.c         show each pass as it runs
 *	    cc -k prog.c         keep the .tok and .ir intermediates
 *	    cc -r prog.bas       build it and, if it built, run it
 *
 *	ccfuzix.c is the driver for the ordinary FCC pipeline, which ends
 *	in an assembler and a linker. This target has neither: cc2 writes
 *	a loadable object directly, so there is nothing to link and one
 *	source file is one program. That, plus the fact that ccfuzix.c
 *	under CPU_armm0 is still configured to emit Z80, is why this is a
 *	separate program rather than another #ifdef in there.
 *
 *	The passes cannot be driven from the shell, which is the other
 *	reason this exists. cc1 and cc2 read back from their own standard
 *	output, so it has to be opened O_RDWR; the Fuzix shell has no
 *	"1<>" and quietly leaves them reading the console instead.
 *
 *	cpp runs first if it is installed. It is not optional in practice
 *	even for source with no directives in it: cc0 does not know what a
 *	comment is - stripping them has always been cpp's job in FCC - so
 *	without it the opening comment marker of the file becomes a divide
 *	followed by a multiply.
