# https://github.com/c-testsuite/c-testsuite - each test is NNNNN.c with
# NNNNN.c.expected holding the expected stdout and NNNNN.c.tags naming
# the C version it needs. A test passes if the program exits 0 and its
# output matches.
#
# We only claim C89, so c99 and c11 tests are reported as out of scope
# rather than as failures. That is a measurement, not an excuse: the
# count is printed either way and -a runs the lot.
#
# Failures are classified by which pass rejected the program, because
# "47 failures" tells you nothing and "31 of them are cc1 rejecting a
# construct" tells you where the work is.
