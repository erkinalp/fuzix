# Dhrystone 2.1 (netlib dhry-c, unpacked from dhry-c.shar) through the
# FCC pipeline and natively.  Local changes to dhry_1.c are the three
# marked islands: -DTIME_US microsecond clock, -DDHRY_RUNS fixed run
# count (no scanf in the bytecode world), nothing else.
#
# The bytecode world has no linker, so the two source files become one
# translation unit: dhry_2.c minus its duplicate #include "dhry.h".
#
#   bash dhry.sh          -> native + host bcrun numbers
#                            /tmp/ccdhry/dhry-board.bc for the PC3
