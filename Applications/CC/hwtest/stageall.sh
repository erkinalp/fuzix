# BUILD FIRST.  This script used to strip and nothing else, while its
# own comment claimed that "getting a STALE one is worse, so this
# restages the lot every time" - and restaging a stale binary is exactly
# what it did.  It shipped a v0.18 card whose bcrun had been compiled
# before MM_RELEASE was bumped, so MM.VER answered 0.17 on it: the very
# bug relcheck.sh was written to prevent, through the one door it does
# not cover.  relcheck compares the three SOURCES; the card carries a
# BINARY, and nothing tied the two together.
#
# make is a no-op when everything is current, so this costs nothing on a
# release that did run relink-userland.sh first - and saves the release
# that did not.  Objects are not deleted here: relink-userland.sh does
# that, and does it for the C library too, which is the case make cannot
# see for itself.

# Every program staged is recorded in staged.list, and mkccimage.sh
# and verifyimage.sh install and check exactly that.  They used to keep
# hand-written lists of their own, which is how playmp3 missed a whole
# release and playmod missed the release that added PLAY MODFILE: the
# binary was built here, staged here, and installed by nobody.  The
# list is written by the thing that does the staging, so it cannot fall
# behind it.  It is a list rather than a glob over *.s because this
# directory also holds leftovers - a stale cc.s from an older native
# driver is still here, and a glob installed it OVER /usr/bin/cc.
