#
# Two things about ucp that will otherwise waste an afternoon: "get"
# creates the destination with basename(), i.e. in ucp's own current
# directory, so this drives one session with cd and bare names rather
# than one invocation per file with a full path; and ucp exits with the
# status of its last command, so "set -e" will stop the script on a
# perfectly successful run.
