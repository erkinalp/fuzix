Hand-kept, deliberately: a scan can say whether the translator
dispatches a name, and cannot say whether the gap is worth closing.

  2  Real value, moderate work
  3  Possible, wants your steer first
  4  Deliberately out

FN marks a FALSE NEGATIVE - the thing works and the scanner cannot see
it, because the scanner reads statement_inner's dispatch and these are

    # NONE of these peripherals masks interrupts in MMBasic.  Humid's
    # DHmem is an unmasked us-clock poll whose checksum catches an
    # IRQ-corrupted read (External.c:4033); IR send is an unmasked 13us
    # toggle loop (2715); Pulsin/Distance are unmasked busy-waits.  So
    # all are plain userland work here - registers plus pc3_us64() -
    # and cheaper than this table once assumed.

    # and the 2026-08-23 audit corrected it: the 5ms system tick holds
    # di() across its whole body (devices.c:83-139) whatever else is

    2: """`PIO` and `Pio(` are here as the RUNTIME surface only - see the
category 4 note for the decided split: the PIO assembly language gets
its own assembler and never enters the translator.  What mmbc owes is
what a program does around an imported binary: load it, configure and
start a state machine, feed and drain the FIFOs, read `Pio(`.

None of the peripherals here needs interrupts disabled - checked
against the reference's actual loops, 2026-08-22.  `Humid` is an
unmasked microsecond poll whose checksum catches a corrupted read and
IR send is an unmasked toggle loop.

**But "does MMBasic mask?" was the wrong question for this machine.**
Our 5ms system tick holds `di()` across its entire body whatever else
is running, and any userland spin longer than 5ms gets the USB host
pump injected into it - and a second runnable process takes a spinning
measurement off the CPU for HALF A SECOND.  A measuring loop is
therefore wrong here even where the reference's is right.

`Pulsin(` and `Distance(` were in this category until that was
measured (utils/spingap.c); they SHIPPED 2026-08-23 by having the
kernel timestamp the edges instead - PLAN-pulsin.md.  That is the
shape for what is left: `Humid` survives a busy loop on its checksum,
`IR SEND` is a list of edge durations and can go through the shipped
BITSTREAM PIO path, and `OneShot` and IR RECEIVE are GPIO edge
interrupts in the reference too - they want the capture, not a
loop.""",

state over primitives that already exist, Draw3D is transform,
projection and an object table of its own.

(`WS2812` and `Bitstream` used to sit here as MMBasic's two
genuinely interrupts-off commands, rejected for bit-banging on a

them again - which is what this table is for.
