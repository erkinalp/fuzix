"""Print the MMBasic coverage appendix, read out of the translator.

  python3 fcc/coverage.py            markdown for the PC3 manual
  python3 fcc/coverage.py --check    just the counts

The lists come from mmb2c.py itself - the statement dispatch in
statement_inner() and the BUILTINS table - so the appendix cannot drift
away from what the translator actually does.

DO NOT PASTE THE WHOLE OUTPUT OVER APPENDIX C.  The manual's appendix
opens with the two tables this prints and then continues with pages of
hand-written detail - the MATH sections, error handling, I2C2, SPI,
one-wire, and a "Not covered" that says far more than the one below.
Replacing the appendix wholesale deletes all of it, which is exactly
what happened once.  Take the two TABLES and leave the prose alone.

print("""# Appendix C: MMBasic coverage

This is what `mmbc` translates today. It is generated from the
translator's own tables (`Applications/mmb2c/fcc/coverage.py`), so
it says what the program does rather than what anyone remembers it
doing.

Coverage grows with each release, and it will never be complete.
MMBasic is a large language whose statements reach deep into one
particular firmware, and a translator that emits portable C cannot
follow all of it. Anything not listed here is reported by name, with
its line number, and the translation continues - so you find out at
translate time, not at run time.

## Statements

Assignment needs no keyword (`LET` is accepted). Statement separators,

## MATH

Scalar functions, `MATH(name ...)`: %s

Whole-array functions, one number out of an array: %s

In place on arrays, `MATH name ...`: %s

`ARRAY` is accepted as a spelling of `MATH` for `SET`, `ADD`, `SLICE`
and `INSERT`, as it is in MMBasic. It is NOT a spelling of the rest:
`ARRAY SCALE` answers `Unknown command` on a real PicoMite, because
`SCALE` and everything below it live only in `cmd_math`.

`INTEGER` (64-bit), `FLOAT` (double), `STRING`, and arrays of each, up
to the dimensions MMBasic allows. `DIM`, `LOCAL`, `STATIC`, `CONST`,
`OPTION BASE`, `SUB` and `FUNCTION` with by-reference arguments, and
the usual control flow.

## Not covered

The immediate-mode environment - the editor, `RUN`, `LIST`, `EDIT`,
`NEW`, `SAVE` and the rest - will never apply, because a translated
program is compiled and run rather than typed at a prompt. MMBasic's
in-language PIO assembly is deliberately out too: it gets an assembler
of its own, so that a PIO block can be written once and imported.

What remains are the hardware statements this port has not reached yet
rather than a class it cannot reach: the display, sound, the GPIO
family, `SETPIN`, `PIN`, `PORT`, I2C, SPI, one-wire and the interrupt
sources are all here. `Applications/mmb2c/COVERAGE-STATUS.md` in the
source tree is the honest name-by-name list, generated the same way
this appendix is, and it says which of the rest are wanted, which want
a decision first, and which do not apply to this machine.

Anything not listed anywhere here is refused BY NAME at translate time,
with its line number - so you find out before you run it, not while it
is running.""")
