"""The MATH family, both halves, with status - read from both sources.

MATH is worth its own section because it is TWO tables inside one
keyword: `MATH <subcommand>` operates on arrays in place, and
`MATH(<subfunction> ...)` returns a value. AllCommands.h has one row
for each, so the main coverage list counts MATH as "translated" and says
nothing at all about the 67 members underneath.

print("""The split is not arbitrary. What is in is what a BASIC program
actually reaches for - the whole-array reductions, the hyperbolic and
log/atan scalars, the in-place array operations, `BASE64` (which the
Gmail recipe made load-bearing: it is the hand branch in `expr`, with
MMBasic's own write-to-the-second-argument shape), and as of
2026-08-24 the whole vector and matrix family: `SHIFT`, `POWER`,
`V_NORMALISE`, `V_CROSS`, `V_PRINT`, `M_PRINT`, `MAGNITUDE`,
`DOTPRODUCT`, then `M_TRANSPOSE`, `M_MULT`, `M_INVERSE`, `V_MULT`,
`V_ROTATE` and `M_DETERMINANT`, and then the quaternions - `Q_CREATE`,
`Q_EULER`, `Q_VECTOR`, `Q_INVERT`, `Q_MULT` and `Q_ROTATE`, and then `MATH(CROSSING)` and
`MATH WINDOW`.
`tests/matha.bas`, `tests/mathm.bas`, `tests/mathq.bas` and
`tests/mathw.bas` cover them,
blessed line by line against a real MMBasic - the inverse is the
reference's cofactor expansion rather than an LU factorisation
precisely so that it can be.

A quaternion here is FIVE floats, not four: `w`, `x`, `y`, `z` and a
MAGNITUDE carried alongside, the first four always normalised. That is
MMBasic's convention, and it is why `Q_VECTOR` of (3, 4, 12) answers
the unit vector and 13.

`tests/mathm1.bas` is the exception that cannot be blessed, and says
so: MMBasic keeps an array's rank in the same `vartbl` entry as its
bounds, where 0 means "simple variable", so **no dimension can have an
extent of 1 under either OPTION BASE** - `DIM a(0)` is refused under
BASE 0 and `DIM a(1)` under BASE 1. We carry the rank separately, so
a 1x1 matrix is an honest array here and a row vector times a column
vector lands in one. A program that wants the NUMBER should still say
`MATH(DOTPRODUCT)`.

What is out divides into three kinds:

* **pure arithmetic, no platform dependency, each independently
  testable against the interpreter** - `CORREL`, `CHI` and `CHI_P`,
  which is all that is left of the statistics. Category 2, to add on
  demand. `CHI_P` wants an incomplete gamma function, so check what
  the Fuzix libc actually has before promising it.
* **codecs and transforms** - `FFT` with its companions `PHASE` and
  `INVERSE`, then `SINC`, `INTERPOLATE` and `AES128`. Bigger pieces,
  still pure arithmetic. `BASE64`, all four `CRC`s and `WINDOW` have
  shipped; of the rest `INTERPOLATE` is small and self-contained,
  `FFT` is now merely large rather than undecided (its complex forms
  want MMBasic's 2-D storage order, which our arrays have had since
  the storage-order change, and `PHASE` and `INVERSE` come with it),
  and `AES128` has no demand behind it.
* **the odd ones out** - `PID` and `SENSORFUSION` carry state between
  calls and want an IMU this machine does not have.  `RAND` used to be
  here; it SHIPPED 2026-08-24 with its own Mersenne twister in
  `mmb_mt.h`, seeded by `MATH RANDOMIZE` and by nothing else - see
  that header for the one deliberate divergence (69069, not the
  reference's 6069).
