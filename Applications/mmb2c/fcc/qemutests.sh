# Native-execution gate for MMBasic-shaped code.
#
#   bash fcc/qemutests.sh              the whole test set
#   bash fcc/qemutests.sh t1           one program
#
# fcctests.sh proves the BYTECODE path only: the x86 bcrun never
# executes a byte of the translated Thumb, so a broken peephole sails
# through it.  This is its native twin.  Every tests/*.bas is REBUILT
# with the current cc2 and run under qemu-arm, three ways:
#
#   native      the mixed object, native spans executing
#   bytecode    the same object under BCRUN_BYTECODE=1 (the referee -
#               same object, interpreter only, so a disagreement is
#               the translator's and nothing else's)
#   reclaimed   a THUMB_RECLAIM=1 build: dead bytecode overwritten,
#               no alias to fall back to, board-shaped
#
# all compared against tests/*.expected.
#
# Why it exists: the 10b statement-seam rewrite shipped wrong code
# because no gate ran mmb-generated shapes natively, and the harness
# that came closest (hosttest/qemudiff.sh) compared objects built
# before the change.  So: nothing here is reused.  The compilers are
# rebuilt, then every object is rebuilt, then they run.  Set
# SKIPBUILD=1 only when iterating on the runtime, never to gate a
# backend change.
#
# MMB2C=... overrides the translator (mmbc/mmbc) exactly as in
# fcctests.sh; THUMB_* knobs pass through to cc2.

# every answer correctly.  It looked mode-specific and was not: native
# passed because it ran first, bcode and rec failed behind it, and
# strargs failed all three because it follows play.  Nothing here is
# about code generation, which is what this gate exists to test.
