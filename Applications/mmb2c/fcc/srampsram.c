/*
 * SRAM against PSRAM, for string-shaped work.
 *
 * Under bcrun a static array lives in mem[], which is the process image
 * and so SRAM; malloc comes from the VM heap, which the kernel carves
 * out of PSRAM (bcrun.c heap_init).  MMBasic's strings and arrays are
 * all malloc'd today, so this is the gap a program pays for every
 * string operation - and the gap a pool of string slots in the image
 * would close.
 *
 * PSRAM is reached through the QMI with the XIP cache in front of it,
 * so the answer depends on the working set: a few string variables may
 * sit in the cache and cost nothing, while an array that does not fit
 * pays the miss on every touch.  Hence three sizes, and the addresses
 * printed so there is no doubt which memory is which.
 *
 * time_us64 is a bcrun native (bcrun.c lc_time_us64) - microseconds,
 * where time() would only have given whole seconds.
