 *	SETPIN and PIN.
 *
 *	These are NOT in bcrun, for the same reason the drawing
 *	primitives are not: bcrun is loaded for every translated program
 *	on the machine, so a byte added there is a byte taken from
 *	programs that never touch a pin.  Here they are file scope
 *	statics, and cc1 generates nothing for a static that nothing
 *	names (hosttest/deadstatic.sh), so a program pays for SETPIN only
 *	if it says SETPIN.
 *
 *	NO SYSCALL ON THE PIN PATH ANY MORE.  There is no MMU on the PC3
 *	and the kernel never drops privilege, so a program reaches the
 *	pin registers with a store; the ioctl this used to make cost
 *	1.488us against about ten nanoseconds for the store it wrapped.
 *	What crosses into the kernel now is one CLAIM per pin, once, at
 *	SETPIN - see <sys/pc3io.h> and the kernel's pinlock.c.  The claim
 *	is what makes the pin come back, reset, when the program exits or
 *	dies; nothing has to give it back by hand.
 *
 *	MMBasic's SETPIN has many more modes than these, and its own pin
 *	NUMBERING (connector pins, not GPIO numbers).  This is the GPIO
 *	number, because that is what the PC3's documentation, its
 *	schematic and every other tool on the machine use, and inventing
 *	a second numbering for one command would be worse than the small
 *	incompatibility.
 *
 *	The bodies below are the SAME on the board and on the host - the
 *	host just gets stubs for the hardware primitives.  That is what
 *	makes a translated program using SETPIN still run under the
 *	gates, and keeps the arithmetic (which is where the interesting
 *	part of AIN is) on the tested path.

 *
 *	Keyed on which compiler compiles the OUTPUT, not on __GNUC__:
 *	fccbuild.sh preprocesses with gcc -E and then feeds cc1, so
