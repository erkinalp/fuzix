/*
 *	MMBasic's software interrupts - the pin half.
 *
 *	The load-bearing fact, and the reason this is a header of statics
 *	rather than anything cleverer: MMBASIC'S INTERRUPTS ARE NOT
 *	INTERRUPTS.  The whole facility is a poll.  No BASIC ever runs
 *	asynchronously there either: the interpreter calls
 *	check_interrupt() after EVERY statement (MMBasic.c:1878), so the
 *	latency guarantee is one statement and a statement is atomic.
 *	Pin "interrupts" are level compares against the level at the
 *	previous check (MM_Misc.c:10153) - there is no GPIO IRQ anywhere
 *	in MMBasic, and a pulse shorter than a statement is missed.
 *
 *	So this is the same algorithm with the level read from a register
 *	instead of MMBasic's PinRead, and it is deliberately NOT a Unix
 *	signal.  Signals were considered and rejected on three grounds:
 *	the kernel is non-preemptive and delivers at syscall boundaries,
 *	so a compiled compute loop would never see one; the runtime's
 *	string scratch stack and queues are not reentrant, while a
 *	statement boundary is exactly where everything is quiescent; and
 *	MMBasic is the proven implementation of this facility AS a poll.
 *	See PLAN-interrupts.md.
 *
 *	Per process, which is a sentence MMBasic could never write: every
 *	BASIC program owns its own table, and two can each run their own.
 *
 *	Costs nothing when unused.  The translator emits the poll only for
 *	a program that arms something, and cc1 emits nothing for a static
 *	that nothing names - the mmb_gpio.h bargain.
