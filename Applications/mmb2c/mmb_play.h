/*
 *	PLAY SOUND / PLAY TONE - the client half.
 *
 *	The synthesiser is a separate process (utils/playsnd.c) holding
 *	the kernel's one PCM stream, spawned by the first SOUND or TONE
 *	and commanded over the control FIFO (mmb_playctl.h).  This
 *	header is the BASIC side: argument checks at the reference's
 *	ranges, the spawn-and-discover dance, and TONE's whole-cycle
 *	duration rounding - done HERE, with doubles the daemon does not
 *	carry, and sent as a sample count.
 *
 *	Discovery is the kernel's SNDIOC_PCMOWNER (via mm_play_owner):
 *	a live owner plus a matching mm_play_kind means the daemon is
 *	up; a live owner with the WRONG kind is the reference's "sound
 *	output in use"; no owner means spawn and poll until the stream
 *	goes live.  PLAY STOP needs nothing new - the daemon catches
 *	the same SIGINT playmp3 does.
 *
 *	The tone-done interrupt costs no IPC at all: the duration is
 *	known at issue, so a DEADLINE is kept here and mmb_int.h's poll
 *	fires the handler when the clock passes it.
