 *	The player control FIFO - the one protocol between mmb_play.h
 *	(the client inside every translated program) and the player
 *	daemons (utils/playsnd.c, utils/playmod.c).
 *
 *	This header exists IN BOTH TREES (mmb2c and Applications/CC),
 *	synced like mmb_runtime.c, and the version byte in every record
 *	is what turns a stale copy into an error instead of a silent
 *	skew - the mmb_gfx_map lesson, applied in advance.
 *
 *	The kernel semantics the protocol leans on were pinned on the
 *	board by utils/fifotest.c: every open carries O_NDELAY (a FIFO
 *	open without it psleeps once, whoever you are); the daemon holds
 *	the FIFO O_RDWR so its read end never sees EOF; an empty-pipe
 *	read returns 0, which is "quiet"; and writes cannot signal a dead
 *	daemon (they buffer), so discovery is SNDIOC_PCMOWNER - the
 *	daemon holds the PCM stream for as long as it lives.
