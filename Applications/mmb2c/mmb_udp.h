/*
 *	WEB UDP - the first network family, and deliberately the
 *	smallest (PLAN-web.md §11 stage 1): the reference is MMudp.c,
 *	whose whole model is one bound receive socket, a fresh socket
 *	per send, and two M-string buffers that MM.MESSAGE$ and
 *	MM.ADDRESS$ read back.
 *
 *	WEB UDP SERVER PORT n     bind the receive socket (the WebMite's
 *	                          saved OPTION UDP SERVER PORT, as a
 *	                          statement - PLAN-web.md §3.2)
 *	WEB UDP INTERRUPT sub     fire on a received datagram
 *	WEB UDP SEND ip$, port, msg$
 *
 *	Receive is a poll, like every MMBasic interrupt here: mmb_int.h
 *	calls mmg_udp_poll() under this file's include guard, decimated,
 *	from the slot where the WebMite checks its network one-shots
 *	(MM_Misc.c:10015-10029).  The socket is O_NDELAY so the poll
 *	never sleeps.
 *
 *	SEND takes a dotted quad or a hostname - the mmb_net.h resolver
 *	(stage 2) sits behind mmn_aton exactly as MMudp.c's DNS path
 *	sits behind ip4addr_aton.
 *
 *	Faithful details: a datagram longer than 255 bytes is truncated
 *	(a BASIC string is the destination), nulls inside are kept - the
 *	M-string length carries them - and the address string is the
 *	sender's IP alone, no port, exactly as addressbuff has it.
