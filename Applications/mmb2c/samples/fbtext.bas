' PRINT @(x, y) - text on graphics, in place, with nothing scrolling.
'
' The thing this is here to show: the counter is redrawn every frame at
' the same spot, over a moving picture, and the picture does not move
' underneath it.  Before, a PRINT in MODE 2 went to the console, the
' console drew into the SCREEN framebuffer, and a wrapped line scrolled
' the whole display - so a counter like this was unusable.
'
' Now PRINT draws glyphs through whatever is being drawn on, as MMBasic
' does, so the text goes into the off-screen buffer with everything else
' and arrives on the screen with the frame.
