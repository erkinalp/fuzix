' QNH station - a worked example of most of what the PC3 can reach.
'
'   an ILI9341 panel on SPI0          a BMP180 barometer on I2C2
'   a potentiometer on the ADC        the DS3231 clock, via TIME$/DATE$
'   PWM for the backlight             MMBasic's own fonts, drawn by hand
'
' It shows the time, the date, the temperature, the station pressure
' and - set by the potentiometer - the height above sea level, from
' which it computes QNH: the pressure the sensor would read if it were
' at sea level, which is the number an altimeter is set to.
