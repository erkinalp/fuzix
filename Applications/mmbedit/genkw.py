"""Generate mmbedit's keyword tables.

Two sources, neither of them hand-maintained:

  - the NAMES come from MMBasic's own AllCommands.h, so the editor
    colours exactly what MMBasic recognises;
  - the SUPPORTED flag comes from mmb2c.py's statement dispatch and
    BUILTINS table, via the same reader fcc/coverage.py uses, so what
    the editor calls translatable is what the translator actually does.

Regenerate after either changes:
