/*
   tftpd - a trivial file transfer protocol server (RFC 1350)

	tftpd [-q] [-r] [-p port] [directory]

   Ported from MMBasic's, which is `net/MMtftp.c' hooked onto lwIP's
   `apps/tftp/tftp.c'.  MMBasic supplies only the five file callbacks;
   the protocol lives in lwIP.  Fuzix has no lwIP in userland - the
   stack is behind the socket layer - so the state machine had to come
   across with the callbacks, and this file is that state machine
   written against recvfrom/sendto.

   It is deliberately the SAME machine: one socket, bound to port 69,
   which is also the port every reply leaves from, one transfer at a
   time, a ten second timeout and five retries.  A client locks its
   transfer identifier onto whatever port the first DATA or ACK comes
   from, so replying from 69 is legal and is what every PicoMite has
   been doing; keeping it means one socket rather than two, which
   matters where the kernel has eight.

   Five things are deliberately NOT the same, and each is a fix rather
   than a preference:

   1.	The file is opened relative to the directory tftpd was started
	in, a leading `/' is dropped and a path containing `..' is
	refused - as httpd(1) next door does, and for the same reason:
	there is no chroot here and the whole disc is one namespace.
	MMBasic serves one SD card and has no such worry.

   2.	A filename may be 128 characters.  lwIP allows twenty, which is
	shorter than a Fuzix name plus the directory it is in.

   3.	An ACK for a block already sent is IGNORED.  lwIP answers it
	with ERROR "Wrong block number", which kills the transfer at
	the first lost packet: a client whose DATA n went missing
	re-sends ACK n-1, which is exactly this case.  Resending the
	data on a duplicate ACK is the other wrong answer - it is the
	Sorcerer's Apprentice, where one duplicate makes two - so RFC
	1123 4.2.3.1 says to do neither and let the timer retransmit.
	That is what happens here.

   4.	A write that runs out of card reports error 3, disk full,
	instead of error 2.  The client then says so.

   5.	-r refuses writes, and -q is `option suppress status'.

   netascii is not converted, as in MMBasic: both modes move the bytes
   through unchanged and the mode is only reported.  Use octet, which
   is what every client defaults to for anything that is not text.

   Options (RFC 2347: blksize, tsize, timeout) are ignored, which is
   what that RFC says a server that does not implement them must do -
   the client sees no OACK and falls back to plain 512-byte blocks.

   One wart is kept because the reference has it: nothing lingers after
   a transfer ends.  If the last ACK of a write is lost the client
   re-sends its last DATA, which arrives with no transfer in progress
   and is answered "No connection" - so the client reports a failure
   for a file that did in fact arrive whole.  A real BSD tftpd dallies
   a moment for exactly this; doing so here means keeping the peer and
   the last packet alive past the end of the transfer, which is more
   state than the one case has yet been seen to be worth.
