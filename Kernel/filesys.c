 *	  * V7 frees on i_nlink <= 0 alone. This also required CDIRTY, so
 *	    an inode whose last link and last reference went away without
 *	    anything having dirtied it was never returned to the free list
 *	    and never had its mode cleared on disk - it stayed allocated
 *	    with nothing pointing at it.
 *	  * V7 finishes with "ip->i_flag = 0; ip->i_number = 0;" - the
 *	    cache entry is dead and can never be found again. This left
 *	    c_num set, so a later i_open could still match the entry by
 *	    number and validate against a copy of an inode that no longer
 *	    described anything. That is where the in-core inode and the
 *	    disk came to disagree.
 *	  * V7 holds ILOCK across itrunc. i_lock() is a no-op in this

     * over fsck's correction on the next sync.

     * that is a live file, which surfaces as "i_open: bad disk inode"
     * and then, misleadingly, ENFILE - "File table overflow" - from
     * the create path, on a filesystem fsck calls clean.
