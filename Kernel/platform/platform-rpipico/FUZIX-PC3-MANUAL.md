# Introduction

Fuzix is Alan Cox's compact V7-style Unix. This port makes it a third
first-class environment for the Pico Computer, beside MMBasic and
MicroPython: a genuine multi-tasking Unix booting from SD card, with a
full set of classic utilities — and R. T. Russell's BBC BASIC as its
flagship application, complete with BBC graphics modes on the HDMI
display, the four-channel BBC sound system on the audio DAC, joystick
and analogue inputs, and a spare serial port.

It also compiles on its own. `cc` is a complete C89 toolchain running on
the hardware — not a cross-compiler — and it generates native ARM code,
so the machine builds its own programs, at its own speed, with no PC
involved. `mmbc` puts MMBasic in front of it: an MMBasic program
translates to C, compiles, and runs as a native program several times
faster than the interpreter it was written for.

One kernel image serves both machines. At boot it probes GP27 for the
DS3231's 32 kHz clock (the same test MMBasic and MicroPython use):
present means Pico Computer 3, absent means Pico Computer 2. The
practical difference is the SD card wiring, handled automatically; the
boot banner names the detected board.

Headline specification as configured here:

* CPU at 378 MHz, which is what the video timings are cut from: the
  text console lands on 640x480 at exactly 60.0 Hz and the graphics
  modes on 1024x768 at 70.6 Hz
* 340 KB of program RAM managed as 4 KB pages, with the 8 MB PSRAM
  behind it — up to 64 concurrent processes, and a single process may
  have about 292 KB of it. A swapped-out process is a PSRAM allocation
  the size of the process, not a slot on a device, so nothing is
  reserved for one that does not exist
* Programs get their heap from the PSRAM too, so a BASIC array or a C
  `malloc` is limited by the 8 MB rather than by the process
* Root filesystem on SD card. The on-board flash holds the kernel and
  nothing else: the flash filesystem that used to live above it was
  taken out, because it pinned 7,912 bytes of SRAM in place - code
  cannot execute from a device that is being erased
* 80×40 colour ANSI console on HDMI, mirrored to the USB-C serial
  port, with USB keyboard support (six layouts)
* Pre-emptive multitasking: a runaway program can always be stopped
  from the keyboard
* A self-hosted C89 compiler generating native ARM code, and an
  MMBasic translator in front of it — both run on the machine itself
* MMBasic's own full-screen editor, `mmbedit`, so BASIC is written,
  translated, compiled and run without leaving the machine

## New in v0.27

**A program that would not start, and the knob that starts it.** A
compiled program has to fit the process pool *beside the biggest other
process* — usually the shell you typed the command into — so that the
swapper can always bring it back in. When it does not, the kernel says
so and names what it could not fit beside:

```
exec: pid 27 needs 76 blocks, 74 free beside a 10-block neighbour (pool 84)
```

That is not a report of free memory, and reading it as one sends you
looking at the wrong number. `THUMB_BUDGET` is the answer: it caps the
native code the compiler adds, so a large program keeps most of its
speed and still loads. PETSCII Robots grew past the line and comes back
under it with `THUMB_BUDGET=140000 cc robots.bas` — 209,022 bytes and
76 blocks uncapped, 196,782 and under 74 with the cap. The knob is not
new; having it written down is. See
[When a program will not start](#thumb-budget), which also covers
`THUMB_VERBOSE`, `BCODE_ONLY`, and what `exec ./prog.bc` is good for.

**Every compiled program is smaller, because `main` now gives back its
dead bytecode.** A function translated to native ARM has kept its
original bytecode since the translator learned to reclaim it — except
the main line, excluded by a comment that had outlived the code it
described. `bcrun` has entered `main` natively for some time and
handles a marker with no bytecode to fall back to, so the exclusion was
costing every program its main line twice over: 5,428 bytes of code and
two thirds of its relocations on Robots, and far more for a program
whose work sits in one long main line rather than in `Sub`s.

**The translator lives in the tree.** `Applications/mmb2c` now holds
the MMBasic-to-C translator, the Python reference implementation it is
checked against byte for byte, the runtime headers and the BASIC
corpus, and `Applications/CC` compiles `mmbc` and `bcrun` straight out
of it. It used to be a separate repository whose files were copied
across by two sync scripts, and a copy that went stale was invisible:
everything built, every host gate passed, and the board ran code the
source no longer described. There is one of each file now and nothing
to re-run. Nothing about the machine changes; the binaries it produces
are byte-identical.


# Installing Fuzix

## Flashing the kernel

The kernel is a standard UF2 file, `fuzix.uf2`, flashed exactly like
any other Pico Computer firmware:

1. Set the USB HUB switch to **DISABLE** and connect the **Prog**
   port to your PC.
2. Hold **BOOT**, click **RESET**, release BOOT. A USB drive appears.
3. Drag `fuzix.uf2` onto the drive. The board reboots when the copy
   completes.
4. Set the HUB switch back to **ENABLE**.

Flashing does not touch the SD card.

## Writing the SD card

Fuzix boots from a ready-made card image, `pc3-sd.img` (978 MB, about
4.9 MB compressed for download). Write it to a card of **1 GB or
larger** with any raw-image tool — Raspberry Pi Imager ("use custom
image"), Win32DiskImager, balenaEtcher, or `dd` on Linux/macOS. **The
whole card is overwritten.**

The image lays the card out as three partitions:

| Partition | Size   | Type       | Purpose                                  |
|-----------|--------|------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1         | 128 MB | FAT        | File interchange with Windows/macOS/Linux |
| 2         | 800 MB | Fuzix root | The Unix filesystem (boot device `hda2`) |
| 3         | 4 MB   | 0x7F       | Reserved                                 |

The root filesystem is 1,638,400 blocks of 512 bytes with 25,600
inodes, and it fills its partition exactly.

It did not always. Before v0.9 a block number was 16 bits, so 65535
was at once the highest block a filesystem could have and the marker
meaning "no such block" — and the filesystem was deliberately held to
64000 blocks, short of its own partition, so that a stray value could
be recognised as wrong instead of pointing at a real sector. That is
what limited the root to 32 MB. From v0.9 the format is **FS32**:
32-bit block numbers and 256-byte inodes, with a "no such block"
marker that cannot be a real block at all. The margin is gone, and
with it the ceiling — a filesystem can now be up to 2 TB and a single
file up to 1 GB.

**A v0.9 kernel and a v0.9 card go together.** The two formats are
not interchangeable and neither pretends otherwise: a v0.9 kernel
refuses an older card by name — the automatic mount fails and the
`bootdev:` prompt appears — and an older kernel refuses a v0.9 one.
Flash `fuzix.uf2` and write the card in the same sitting.

Since v0.5 the filesystem has been built from source by
`mksdimage.sh`, so the card can be reproduced rather than merely
copied. `mkcard.sh` decides the layout, and its `FAT_MB` and `ROOT_MB`
settings are the only place the partition sizes are written down.

Partition 1 ships unformatted: format it as **FAT or FAT32 (not
exFAT)** in Windows before first use — see section 6. Partition 2 is
Fuzix's own filesystem format; no desktop OS can mount it, which is
why the FAT partition and the `fat` command exist.

## First boot

Connect a monitor to the HDMI port and/or a terminal program (for
example TeraTerm at 115200) to the USB-C console port. Switch on:
the kernel banner, board identification and device probe appear on
both, the root filesystem mounts itself from the SD card, then:

```
login: root
```

There is nothing to type before `login:`. Earlier releases stopped at
a `bootdev:` prompt whose only sensible answer was `hda2`; since
v0.19 the kernel answers it. **Hold any key while the machine boots**
to get the prompt back — that is how to name a different partition or
pass `tty=...` options — and if the automatic mount fails (no card,
or a card the kernel refuses), the prompt appears by itself.

There is no password. The system arrives at a Bourne shell; the
console is an 80×40 colour terminal (termcap type `pc3`) and the USB
keyboard and serial input feed the same session interchangeably. Set
the keyboard layout in `/etc/rc` (`picoctl keymap uk` by default).

**Auto-repeat** waits 250 ms and then repeats every 50 ms — twenty a
second. HID keyboards only report a change of state, so the repeat is
synthesised from the held key. These were MMBasic's 600/150, which is
a typewriter's rate and fine for typing, but anything *held* suffers:
a game played from the keyboard crawled beside the same game played
from a switch array, which is read fresh every pass of its loop with
no typematic delay at all. The standard `KBRATE` tty ioctl adjusts
them at run time, but note that its units are TENTHS of a second and
so cannot express the 50 ms default.

### Num lock, and keyboards with no keypad

A keyboard with no numeric keypad — a Raspberry Pi keyboard, and most
laptop-style boards — usually overlays one onto `7890`/`uiop`/`jkl;`/`m`
whenever num lock is on, so those letters type digits. The keyboard's
own firmware does that, in response to the num lock light the machine
asks it to show.

Two things handle it. A keyboard that reports **no num lock light** is
taken to have no keypad and starts with num lock off (it says so at
boot). That does not catch every such keyboard — one that reports a num
lock light while having no keypad is indistinguishable from a full-size
keyboard — so **pressing Num Lock is also remembered**, per keyboard.

To ask what is going on:

```
# picoctl numlock
num lock on
keyboard 04d9:0006, num lock LED declared
```

and to change it: `picoctl numlock off`. **That is remembered across
reboots**: the kernel itself writes no files, so `picoctl` keeps a line
per keyboard in `/etc/numlock` whenever a setting changes, and `/etc/rc`
replays them with `picoctl numlock --load` at every boot. Add `--once`
to change the setting without saving it. The full syntax, including
setting a keyboard that is not plugged in yet, is in
[Commands at the `#` prompt](#shell-commands).

One thing that can mislead: the keyboard remembers its own num-lock
state, and the hub is externally powered, so it keeps that state across
a warm reboot. A reading taken right after a reboot tells you what the
keyboard is doing, not what the machine decided.

To power off, type `shutdown` (or at minimum `sync`, then wait a
moment). After an unclean power-off the next boot repairs the
filesystem automatically (`fsck -a -y`).

## Setting the clock

The board's DS3231 battery-backed clock supplies the date and time:
at every boot `/etc/rc` runs `setdate`, which reads the chip and sets
system time silently. If the chip cannot supply a valid time (fresh
battery, or the battery was removed) the same command falls back to
prompting on the console:

```
Current date is Mon 2026-07-27
Enter new date:
```

Press Enter to keep a value, or type a new one (`2026-07-28`, then
`16:30:00`). To set the clock at any other time run `setdate -u`,
which always prompts.

Setting the system time does not touch the chip. To make the time
permanent, write it back:

```
# setdate -w
writing
```

That also restarts a stopped oscillator, so the sequence for a new
battery is: `setdate -u` (enter the time), then `setdate -w`. The
kernel message `oscillator was stopped, time needs setting` at boot
means exactly that sequence is wanted.

While running, system time is kept by the crystal-driven timer tick
and gently re-synchronised from the DS3231 about once an hour, the
same policy as MMBasic. `date` prints the current time.

If a transaction to the chip is ever interrupted at the wrong moment
(a reset mid-read), the battery-backed DS3231 can be left jamming the
I2C bus - even across power cycles. The kernel detects this at boot
(`ds3231: SDA held low, clocking bus free`) and clears it
automatically.

## Command history and line editing

At any cooked-mode prompt - the shell, login, most line-oriented
programs - the console provides in-line editing and command history:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Up / Down | walk back / forward through previous commands |
| Left / Right | move within the line |
| Home / End (or Ctrl-A / Ctrl-E) | start / end of line |
| Backspace / Delete | delete left / at the cursor |
| Ctrl-U | discard the line |

The history (about 500 commands) lives in a small region reserved at
the top of the PSRAM, so it costs no program memory; like
the RAM disc it survives a reset but not a power cycle.  Programs
that take the terminal raw (BBC BASIC, the editor) see every
keystroke themselves as usual - BBC BASIC has its own line editor
and *EDIT.

## Escape routes

* **Esc** — inside BBC BASIC, stops the running program.
* **Ctrl-\\** — kernel emergency break: kills the foreground program
  even if it has the terminal in raw mode, and restores a sane
  terminal. Use it instead of the RESET button when something wedges.
* `kill` from the shell works on anything; Fuzix pre-emption
  guarantees a spinning process can't lock you out.

# The consoles

Everything is mirrored: kernel and program output appear on the HDMI
display and the serial console simultaneously, and input is merged
from the USB keyboard and the serial line. TeraTerm is resized to
80×40 automatically at boot.

While BBC BASIC has a graphics MODE on screen, the HDMI display
belongs to the graphics; text output continues to the serial side as
a plain stream, so a transcript survives even a full-screen game.

# BBC BASIC

Start it by name; leave with `QUIT`:

```
# bbcbasic
BBC BASIC for Fuzix Console v0.50
(C) Copyright R. T. Russell, 2025
>
```

This is R. T. Russell's BBC BASIC (the BBCSDL console edition), so
the language is the full modern dialect: 64-bit integers, IEEE
double floats, long variable names, `WHILE`/`ENDWHILE`, multi-line
`IF`/`ELSE`/`ENDIF`, structures, and the inline assembler. Keywords
must be typed in **capitals** (`PRINT`, not `print`); `*LOWERCASE ON`
relaxes this. Star commands are case-insensitive.

## Loading programs, including plain text

`LOAD` and `CHAIN` accept **both** program formats:

* the tokenised internal format written by `SAVE` (fast, exact), and
* **plain ASCII listings**, detected automatically. An unnumbered
  modern-style listing is given line numbers 10, 20, 30…; a listing
  with its own numbers keeps them. Windows line endings are fine, and
  typographic characters that desktop editors introduce (curly
  quotes, non-breaking spaces, tabs) are silently converted to their
  ASCII equivalents — an invisible "smart" character can otherwise
  produce a baffling `Syntax error` on a line that looks perfect.

The comfortable round trip: edit `myprog.bas` on your PC, copy it to
the FAT partition, then:

```
# fat get myprog.bas
# bbcbasic
>LOAD "myprog.bas"
>RUN
>SAVE "MYPROG"          save tokenised for fast loading next time
```

The round trip closes with `fat put myprog.bas`, which writes the
edited program back onto the FAT partition for the PC to pick up.

## Graphics

`MODE 0`–`5` switch the display to 1024×768 and provide the classic
screens; `MODE` with any higher number (e.g. `MODE 6`) returns to the
text console. Errors leave you at the prompt *in* the current mode,
exactly like the original machine.

| MODE | Resolution | Colours | Presentation on the monitor            |
|------|------------|---------|----------------------------------------|
| 0, 3 | 640×256    | 2       | Full width (5:8 smooth upscale), full height |
| 1, 4 | 320×256    | 4       | 960×768 — every pixel a crisp 3×3 block |
| 2, 5 | 160×256    | 16      | 960×768 — every pixel a crisp 6×3 block |

Coordinates are the authentic 1280×1024 graphics units, origin
bottom-left, movable with `VDU 29`. Implemented: `MOVE`, `DRAW`,
`PLOT` (move/line families 0–15, points 64–71, filled triangles
80–87 — so `PLOT 85` works), `CLG`, `GCOL`, `COLOUR`, `POINT(x,y)`,
`VDU 19` palette changes (instant, no redraw), `TAB(x,y)`, and text
printed with the built-in 8×8 font (40 or 80 columns × 32 rows, with
scrolling). `MODE 1`/`4` store 4 bits per pixel, so all 16 logical
colours are available there via `VDU 19` even though the default
palette is the authentic four.

## Sound

The full BBC sound system plays through the PCM5102 DAC and the
3.5 mm jack:

```
SOUND 1,-15,89,20                          A4 (440 Hz) for one second
ENVELOPE 1,1,4,-4,4,10,10,10,126,-2,0,-10,120,100
SOUND 1,1,100,30                           envelope-shaped note
SOUND &201,-15,53,20:SOUND &202,-15,69,20:SOUND &203,-15,81,20
                                           a synchronised C-E-G chord
```

Channels 1–3 are square-wave tones, channel 0 is noise. Each channel
queues up to 8 notes; `&1x` in the channel number flushes the queue.
`&Sxx` holds the note until S *other* channels carry the same sync
mark, so a three-note chord wants `&2xx` on each channel — `&1xx`
releases in pairs, playing two notes and leaving the third waiting
for a partner that never comes. `ENVELOPE` implements the
three-section pitch envelope and ADSR amplitude, stepped at the
authentic 100 Hz. Pitch follows the BBC scale: 4 units per semitone,
89 = A4 = 440 Hz. Durations are in 20ths of a second; 255 means
"until further notice". `SOUND` blocks BBC-style when a queue is
full (Esc still works).

A note on character. The output is hot: one full-amplitude
(`-15`) square is a quarter of DAC full scale and three sum to
nearly three-quarters, which can clip a sensitive line input that
handles MP3 playback happily — drop to `-7` if the input distorts.
The squares themselves are band-limited (polyBLEP), so sustained
notes hold a pure pitch right to the top of the range instead of
carrying the aliasing shimmer a naive digital square picks up.

There is one audio output, so the synthesiser and MP3 playback are
mutually exclusive — as they are in MMBasic. While a track is playing,
notes are queued and heard when it ends; `PLAY STOP`, or `kill`ing
`playmp3`, gives the synthesiser the hardware back at once.

## ADVAL: joystick, analogue inputs, sound queues

| Call         | Returns                                                |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `ADVAL(0)`   | Joystick switches on GP34–37 as a mask: bit 0 = GP34, bit 1 = GP35, bit 2 = GP36, bit 3 = GP37; pressed (grounded) = 1 |
| `ADVAL(1)`–`ADVAL(4)` | Analogue readings of GP41–GP44, 0–65520 (12-bit ADC ×16) |
| `ADVAL(-1)`  | Characters waiting in the keyboard buffer               |
| `ADVAL(-5)`–`ADVAL(-8)` | Free queue slots on sound channels 0–3       |
| `ADVAL(-9)`  | Hardware microsecond counter (64-bit)                  |

The joystick inputs have pull-ups and Schmitt-trigger inputs enabled;
wire switches directly to ground. The analogue inputs are 3.3 V
full-scale.

`ADVAL(-9)` is the benchmarking clock — the RP2350's free-running
microsecond timer, far finer than `TIME`'s centiseconds (which tick
in tenths of a second on this kernel). MMBasic-style usage:

```
DEF FNtimer = ADVAL(-9)
T% = FNtimer
REM ... code under test ...
PRINT (FNtimer - T%) / 1000; " ms"
```

Each reading costs one system call (a few tens of microseconds) -
negligible over millisecond-scale measurements. The value is the full
64-bit hardware counter (BBC BASIC integers are 64-bit), counting
microseconds since power-on: it never wraps in practice.

## Serial port

A second serial port lives on the I/O header: **TX = GP0, RX = GP1**
(3.3 V logic, no flow control), visible as `/dev/tty2`. BBC BASIC
reaches it as a *port channel* — raw and unbuffered:

```
*stty 9600 </dev/tty2
ch% = OPENUP("/dev/tty2")
BPUT#ch%,65                 send a byte
X% = BGET#ch%               receive a byte (waits for one)
CLOSE#ch%
```

Any `stty` setting applies (baud rate, parity, size). The same
`OPENIN`/`OPENUP`/`BGET#`/`BPUT#` mechanism works on any `/dev`
device; ordinary file names get the buffered 256-byte file channels
instead, exactly as on the original machine.

## Star commands and the shell

The built-in set includes `*DIR`/`*.`, `*CD`, `*TYPE`, `*COPY`,
`*DELETE`/`*ERA`, `*MKDIR`, `*RMDIR`, `*KEY`, `*SPOOL`, `*EXEC`,
`*LOWERCASE`, `*TEMPO`, `*QUIT`. Anything unrecognised is passed to
the Unix shell, so `*ls -l`, `*stty 9600 </dev/tty2` and even
`*fat get demo.bas` work from inside BASIC.

## The inline assembler

The assembler between `[` and `]` targets the machine it runs on:
**ARM Thumb (v6-M subset)**, not 6502. `CALL` and `USR` work as
documented for BBCSDL's ARM editions. Machine code written for a BBC
Micro will not run; this is the same situation as every modern BBC
BASIC.

## Differences from the original BBC Micro

Better than the original:

* ~110 KB of program workspace (about 80 KB when graphics are in
  use) against the Model B's 32 KB shared with the screen
* 64-bit integers, double-precision floats, the modern language
* Long file names on a hierarchical filesystem
* The machine multitasks underneath — BASIC is just a process

Not (yet) present, compared with an original machine or full BBCSDL:

* **MODE 7** teletext (MODE 6 and 7 return to the console)
* `VDU 5` text-at-the-graphics-cursor; user-defined characters
  (`VDU 23`) are accepted but not rendered
* PLOT families beyond points/lines/triangles: no circles, arcs,
  ellipses, flood fill or rectangle/parallelogram fills yet
* `GCOL` action modes 1–4 (OR/AND/EOR/invert) plot as mode 0 (set)
* Flashing colours (8–15 map to their steady equivalents)
* `*FX` calls, `INKEY` with negative arguments (keyboard scanning),
  and the 6502 `CALL` interface
* `TIME` advances in 0.1 s steps (the kernel clock granularity)
* Cassette/Econet/ROM filing systems, for obvious reasons

\newpage

# The C compiler

The machine compiles C on its own, with no PC involved. `cc` is Alan
Cox's Fuzix Compiler Kit, retargeted here to a bytecode machine.

```
# cat > hello.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
        printf("hello from Fuzix\n");
        return 0;
}
^D
# cc hello.c
# ./hello.bc
hello from Fuzix
```

`cc prog.c` writes `prog.bc` and makes it executable, so `./prog.bc`
runs it directly — the object starts with `#!/usr/bin/bcrun`, and the
kernel does the rest. `bcrun prog.bc` still works and is the way to run
an object that has lost its execute bit. Options are `-o name`, `-v` to
show each pass as it runs, `-k` to keep the intermediates, and `-r` to
run the program if it built — `cc -r prog.bas` is a build and a run in
one, and is what `mmbedit`'s `F2` uses.
`bcdump prog.bc` disassembles.

`cc` is a driver: it runs `cpp`, then the three compiler passes from
`/usr/lib/cc`. The passes cannot be driven from the shell by hand — two
of them read back from their own standard output, which needs a
redirection the Bourne shell here does not have. Like BBC BASIC, the
compiler lives on the SD card root; there is no second copy anywhere
else, so a card that will not mount is a machine with no compiler.

A small program takes about a second to compile. The dots `cc` prints
are progress, one per top-level declaration.

## What it compiles

**C89, plus declarations after statements** — the one C99 borrowing,
because refusing it is a nuisance out of proportion to the standard it
comes from. Everything else is ANSI C as of 1989: the full type system,
`struct` and `union` including passing and returning them by value,
`enum`, `typedef`, function pointers, `switch`, `goto`, all the usual
operators, 64-bit `long long`, and double-precision floating point.

The compiler is checked against gcc as an oracle: 165 of the 175
applicable tests in the public `c-testsuite` conformance suite pass with
byte-identical output, and a set of samples in the source tree is
diffed against gcc on every change — on the board as well as on the
host.

## Headers and the runtime library

`/usr/lib/cc/include` holds `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`,
`math.h`, `assert.h`, `limits.h` and `stddef.h`. These describe what
`bcrun` actually provides, and they are deliberately **not**
`/usr/include`, which describes the Fuzix C library used by native
binaries.

Available: `printf` `sprintf` `puts` `putchar`; `fopen` `fclose`
`fread` `fwrite` `fgetc` `getc` `fputc` `putc` `fgets` `fputs`
`fprintf` `feof` `fseek` `ftell` `rewind` `fflush` `remove`;
`malloc` `calloc` `realloc` `free` `exit` `atoi` `abs`; `strlen`
`strcpy` `strncpy` `strcat` `strcmp` `strncmp` `strchr` `strrchr`
`memset` `memcpy` `memmove` `memcmp`; and from `math.h`, in double
precision, `sin` `cos` `tan` `asin` `acos` `atan` `atan2` `sinh`
`cosh` `tanh` `sqrt` `exp` `log` `log10` `pow` `floor` `ceil` `fabs`
`fmod`. Each of those is a native function inside `bcrun`, so it runs
at machine speed whatever the calling code is.

`malloc` takes its memory from the PSRAM, not from the program's own
340 KB, so a C program can allocate far more than it could hold
itself. It is asked for once when the program loads; set
`BCRUN_HEAP` to a size in KB in the environment to change how much.

The raw system calls `open` `creat` `close` `read` `write` `lseek`
`unlink` are also linked in, but no header declares them — declare them
yourself if you want them. Two extras reach the hardware: `time_us()`
returns the microsecond counter, and `adval(n)` is the BASIC `ADVAL`
function (joystick, analogue inputs, sound queues).

## Limitations

These are worth knowing before you start a large program.

* **One source file per program.** There is no assembler and no linker:
  `cc2` writes a loadable object directly, so nothing can be linked
  together. `cc` rejects a second source file rather than pretending.
* **Bitfields are not implemented.** `unsigned flags : 3;` is refused
  with a diagnostic. This is the only part of C89 missing.
* **`&` on a library function does not work.** A runtime function is
  resolved by index and has no address, so `&printf` cannot be
  represented. `bcrun` refuses such a program by name when it loads it,
  rather than running it with something wrong in place of an address.
  Pointers to *your own* functions are entirely fine.
* **No wide strings.** `L'x'` is accepted (and equals `'x'` here);
  `L"..."` is refused rather than quietly returned as a narrow array.
* **`printf` rounds halves up.** `%.2f` of `0.125` gives `0.13` where a
  full C library gives `0.12`. A deliberate, documented difference:
  matching the round-half-to-even rule needs exact decimal expansion.

## Speed

`cc2` translates each function it compiles into native Thumb-2 for the
Cortex-M33 and stores that in the object beside the bytecode; `bcrun`
runs the native code and keeps the interpreter for whatever did not
translate. Nothing needs to be asked for — it is simply what the
compiler does.

Dhrystone 2.1, compiled on the machine, runs at about **167,000
Dhrystones/second** — 44% of the same benchmark cross-compiled by
`gcc -O2` for the same chip (379,000). Individual loops do better: a
sieve, a shell sort and an xorshift generator all land within a factor
of two or three of gcc, and double-precision arithmetic uses the
RP2350's hardware co-processor through the same routines the rest of
the system uses.

That figure has moved a long way and is still moving: the same
benchmark ran at 3,808/second on the original pure interpreter and
90,000 as recently as v0.8. Most of the recent ground came from
keeping the hot code in native form rather than from generating better
instructions — binding every library symbol once at load, caching the
hottest local in a register, and inlining the compound assignments
(`i += n`) on the 64-bit and double types that every MMBasic loop
counter uses. Each of those had been quietly leaving native code and
crossing back into the C runtime once per iteration.

A program can be forced to interpret with `BCRUN_BYTECODE=1` in the
environment, which is how the native code is checked against the
interpreter — the two must agree exactly.

What the compiler is *for* is being able to write and build real
programs on the machine itself — utilities, file handling, glue, and
now whole applications where the speed matters. Nothing else on the
Pico Computer can do it: this is a complete toolchain that runs on the
hardware, not a cross-compiler.

The bytecode is also a deliberately language-neutral intermediate form,
so front ends for other languages can share the same back end and
runtime. `mmbc`, the MMBasic translator described next, is the first.

\newpage

# MMBasic: the `mmbc` translator

`mmbc` translates an MMBasic program into C. `cc` compiles that C into
native ARM code. The result runs as an ordinary program, several times
faster than the same source under the MMBasic interpreter, on the same
machine at the same clock.

Nothing about it is a cross-development trick: both programs live on
the SD card and run on the Pico Computer.

## The three commands

```
# mmbc prog.bas          -> prog.c
# cc prog.c              -> prog.bc
# ./prog.bc              runs it
```

`mmbc` writes `prog.c` next to the source and says so. `-o name.c`
puts it somewhere else. Every line it cannot translate is reported with
its line number and left as a comment in the C, so a program that uses
something unsupported still produces a translation you can read, and
tells you exactly where it gave up.

On the machine, `mmbc` writes C for the machine's own compiler. On a
host it writes the slightly different C that gcc prefers; `--fcc` and
`--gcc` force either form, which only matters if you are moving the
generated C between the two.

There is a shortcut. **`cc prog.bas` does both steps in one command**:
it runs `mmbc` for you, into `prog.mb.c` — a deliberately different
name, so that C you wrote yourself in `prog.c` is never overwritten —
compiles that, and deletes it again with the other intermediates. It is
the quickest way to get from BASIC to a running program, and the
examples in this chapter are written the long way only so that each
step is visible. Use `mmbc` on its own — or `cc -k` — whenever you want
to keep the generated C and read it.

## A first program

```
# cat > hello.bas
Print "Hello from MMBasic"
For i = 1 To 5
  Print i, i * i
Next i
^D
# mmbc hello.bas
wrote hello.c
# cc hello.c
....
# ./hello.bc
Hello from MMBasic
 1       1
 2       4
 3       9
 4       16
 5       25
```

The dots from `cc` are one per top-level declaration — a translated
program carries the MMBasic runtime's declarations with it, so there
are a couple of hundred of them even for four lines of BASIC. That is
also why the first compile takes longer than the size of your program
suggests: about half a minute here, and much the same for anything
small.

`Print` with a comma gives MMBasic's tabbed columns, as above.

## A worked example: the KnivD benchmark

This is a published MMBasic benchmark, unmodified. It runs four
thirty-second rounds and reports a score.

```
# cat bench.bas
Print "MMBASIC benchmark (C) KnivD 2016"
Dim integer t, i=0
Dim float x(1000), f=0.0
Dim string s=""
Print "Calculating... ";
count%=0
Do
  s=""
  f=0.0
  i=0
  Timer =0
  Do While Timer<30000
    i=i+2 : f=f+2.0002
    If (i Mod 2)=0 Then
      i=i*2 : i=i\2
      f=f*2.0002 : f=f/2.0002
    End If
    i=i-1
    For t=1 To 100
      f=f-1.0001
      If (f-Int(f))>=0.5 Then
        f=Sin(f*Log(i))
        s=Str$(f,6,6)
      End If
      f=(f-Tan(i))*(Rnd(0)/i)
      If Instr(s,LEFT$(Str$(i),2))>0 Then s=s+"0"
    Next
    x(1+(i Mod 1000))=f
  Loop
  Print Chr$(13)+"Performance: "+Str$((i*1024)\286,8,0)+" grains"
  Inc count%
Loop Until count%=4
End

# mmbc bench.bas

# cc bench.c
.......................................................................
# ./bench.bc
MMBASIC benchmark (C) KnivD 2016
Performance:    55353 grains
Performance:    55360 grains
Performance:    55353 grains
Performance:    55356 grains
```

MMBasic itself scores about 12,000 grains on the same board at the same
clock. Note what the program exercises: 64-bit integers, doubles,
string building, `Str$`, `Instr`, `Sin`, `Log`, `Tan`, `Rnd`, a
thousand-element array and a timer — all of it translated, compiled and
running natively.

Read the timings in this chapter as figures to compare against rather
than constants. They are wall-clock measurements on a machine with
other processes in it, they move a percent or two between runs, and
they drift as the language grows — this one has roughly doubled since
it was first printed here, and the eclipse below has slowed a little
as more of MMBasic went in.

## A worked example: something numerical

A longer one. It is a 3,200-line astronomical calculation (Bessel
elements, lunar and solar series) that reads a date and prints the
circumstances of an eclipse, and it is a good test because every digit
of its output can be checked against other machines. It is among the
examples as `eclipse.bas`, and in `/root/cc` as `solar_eclipse.bas`
with a `solar_eclipse.in` holding a date to feed it:

```
# cd /root/cc
# mmbc solar_eclipse.bas
wrote solar_eclipse.c
# cc solar_eclipse.c
...........................................................
# ./solar_eclipse.bc < solar_eclipse.in
...
event duration          2.61100904 hours
Time taken :     2.168458  Seconds
```

The same program takes 12.5 seconds under MMBasic and 8.8 seconds
under MicroPython on this hardware; every digit printed is identical in
all three. Translating and compiling it together takes about twenty
seconds — it is a hundred and forty kilobytes of C, so it is much the
longest build in this manual.

This one was 1.95 seconds at v0.13, with rather less of MMBasic
implemented; the digits of the answer have not moved.

## What the translation looks like

The C is meant to be read. Variables keep their names, control flow
keeps its shape, and the MMBasic semantics that C does not share —
integer division, `Mod` on negative numbers, string handling, the
64-bit integer/double type rules — are handled by a small runtime
inside `bcrun` rather than by rewriting your program into something
unrecognisable.

```
# mmbc hello.bas
# head -20 hello.c
```

is worth doing once, to see what your program became.

## Strings, arrays and functions

Strings are MMBasic strings: `Dim string s` gives the usual 255
characters, and `Dim string s length 40` the shorter form. Arrays index
from `OPTION BASE` as they should, and `Bound()` reports their limits.
`Sub` and `Function` work, including arrays passed by reference and
modified in place.

Arrays and strings live in the PSRAM heap, so what limits them is the
8 MB rather than the size of a process. A framebuffer-sized array —
`Dim Integer fb(4800)`, 38,408 bytes — is unremarkable now; before v0.6
it would not fit at all. Simple variables stay in the program's own
memory, where they are quicker to reach, which is the same split
MMBasic itself makes and for the same reason.

`LOCAL` arrays and strings get their own block for each call, released
when the routine returns, so a recursive routine sees its own copy at
every level. `STATIC` locals are unaffected — they are meant to outlive
the call, so they stay where they were.

The one thing to remember is that a translated program is a *program*,
not an interactive session: there is no editor, no `RUN`, no immediate
mode. You edit the `.bas` file, translate, compile and run — which is
also why a translated program can be put in `/usr/bin` and used like
any other command.

## Errors

`mmbc` reports what it could not translate, by line, and carries on:

```
# mmbc gpio.bas
2 line(s) could not be translated and were commented out:
  line 2: expected '='
  line 3: 'pin' is not an array
wrote gpio.c
```

The reasons are the translator's own — it reads `SetPin GP1, DOUT` as
far as it can and then says what it wanted to see — so they name the
symptom rather than the statement. The lines themselves appear in the
C as comments, with the original text, which is the quickest way to
see what was dropped:

```
    /*     SetPin GP1 , DOUT */
```

The translation still happens and everything else works. `--strict`
stops on the first such line instead, and `--report` lists them again
at the end along with any implied global variables.

Appendix C lists what is covered.

## Graphics

A translated program draws on the HDMI display with MMBasic's own
statements:

```basic
MODE 2
COLOUR RGB(YELLOW)
LINE 0, 0, 319, 239
CIRCLE 160, 120, 60, , , RGB(WHITE), RGB(BLUE)
PIXEL 10, 10, RGB(RED)
```

Two modes are available, chosen to match the VGA builds of MMBasic and
the first two HDMI modes:

| `MODE` | Resolution | Colours |
|--------|------------|---------|
| `MODE 1` | 640×480 | monochrome |
| `MODE 2` | 320×240 | 16, from MMBasic's RGB121 set |

**That table is the whole difference between them.** Everything else
behaves identically in the two modes — console output, `PRINT`, `PRINT
@`, `TEXT`, `INPUT` and its echo — and identically to a PicoMite with
`OPTION LCDPANEL CONSOLE`, subject to `OPTION CONSOLE`.

In both, a `MODE` statement means the program has taken the screen:
`PRINT` draws glyphs at `MM.INFO(HPOS)`/`VPOS` — MMBasic's `CurrentX`
and `CurrentY`, the same pen `TEXT` and `PRINT @` move — and the
kernel's own console stops painting on the display until the program
ends. It keeps writing to the serial port throughout, which is what
makes a `PRINT` usable as a trace while a program owns the screen, and
what `OPTION CONSOLE SERIAL` leaves you with deliberately.

A `PIXEL` outside the screen is **dropped**, which is what the
interpreter does. Older releases here masked the coordinates instead,
so `PIXEL 1030, 100` appeared at x=6 — a program written against that
will look different.

`RGB()` takes the usual named colours and `RGB(r,g,b)`. `COLOUR` sets
the current drawing colour, which every statement uses when no colour
is given. `LINE`, `CIRCLE` and the rest take MMBasic's argument order,
including the blank arguments — `CIRCLE x, y, r, , , fill` is written
exactly as MMBasic writes it.

### Shapes from arrays, and filling

```basic
DIM x(5), y(5)
POLYGON 6, x(), y(), RGB(WHITE), RGB(RED)   ' outline, then fill
POLYGON 0, x(), y()                          ' 0 = as many as the array holds
BEZIER cx(), cy(), , RGB(CYAN)               ' n control points
FILL 100, 80, RGB(GREEN)                     ' flood from a point
FILL 100, 80, RGB(GREEN), RGB(WHITE)         ' ...up to a boundary colour
```

`POLYGON` is always closed — the edge from the last vertex back to the
first is drawn, and the fill assumes it. Coordinates may be integer or
float arrays. **Concave outlines fill correctly**: the fill collects
every edge crossing on each row and fills between alternate pairs, so
an arrowhead's notch stays empty. The multi-polygon form, where the
first argument is an array of vertex counts, is not translated.

`BEZIER` takes **integer** control-point arrays, which is MMBasic's own
restriction, and at most sixteen of them.

`FILL` has MMBasic's two modes: given a boundary colour it fills
everything reachable that is not that colour; without one it replaces
the colour it finds under the starting point. Note that boundary mode
fills *over* other colours — it stops only at the boundary. A circle
interior takes about 6 ms and a whole 320×240 screen about 75 ms.

The drawing primitives live in headers as static functions, one header
per primitive — `mmb_gfx_circle.h`, `mmb_gfx_box.h`, `mmb_gfx_rbox.h`,
`mmb_gfx_triangle.h`, `mmb_gfx_arc.h`, `mmb_gfx_text.h`,
`mmb_gfx_map.h`, over the shared batch helpers in `mmb_gfx_pts.h` —
and the translator
includes exactly the ones the program uses, so a program that never
draws a circle does not carry the circle code. (`cc` discards a
file-scope static nothing calls, but that rule counts names rather
than reachability, so a recursive primitive survives inside any header
that carries it — which is why the include, not the static, is the
unit that matters.) And a whole shape crosses
into the kernel in a single call, so a 640-point line is one syscall,
not 640 — measured at 71 µs against 433 µs for the naive version.

The geometry is MMBasic's, copied rather than re-derived, down to the
dotted appearance of a stretched ellipse. If a picture differs from
MMBasic's, that is a bug worth reporting.

**One caution.** In `MODE 1` the console and the graphics share a
single framebuffer, so anything printed — including the cursor —
appears on the picture. It is visible in a `SAVE IMAGE` of the whole
screen as a difference in the top text line. Restricting the saved
region avoids it; directing program output elsewhere is planned.

## The sixteen colours: `MAP`

`MODE 2` stores a colour *number* per pixel, 0 to 15, and `MAP` says
what colour each number actually is. Change entry 8 and everything
already drawn in colour 8 changes with it — without redrawing a single
pixel. That is what makes fades, flashes and colour cycling free.

```basic
MAP(4) = RGB(255, 128, 0)      ' collect
MAP SET                        ' ... and apply, all at once
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `MAP(n) = colour` | set entry `n`, 0 to 15. **Nothing changes yet** |
| `MAP SET` | apply the collected palette, during the frame blanking |
| `MAP RESET` | back to the mode's own sixteen |
| `MAP MAXIMITE` | the original Colour Maximite's sixteen |
| `MAP GRAYSCALE` | sixteen greys, 0 to 255 in steps of 17 (`GREYSCALE` too) |

The two-step is the point, and it is MMBasic's own: applying a new
palette one entry at a time shows the picture half recoloured, and
`MAP SET` waits for the blanking so the change lands between frames.

`MAP(n)` is also a **function**, giving the colour entry `n` stands for
by default — which is the colour a program must ask for to land on that
entry:

```basic
FOR i = 0 TO 15
  LINE i * 20, 0, i * 20, 199, , MAP(i)     ' one line per entry
NEXT i
```

It reports the default and takes no notice of any remapping, exactly as
MMBasic does; it is the inverse of the fixed rule that turns a colour
into an entry number. That rule is bit extraction — one bit of red, two
of green, one of blue — and it does **not** depend on the palette, so
remapping never moves where new drawing lands.

`MAP` needs a 16-colour mode; in `MODE 1` it is an error.

### `COLOUR MAP` — a whole array at once

`COLOUR MAP in%(), out%()` is the array form of the `MAP()` function: it
turns a whole array of colour codes 0-15 into RGB888 colours in one
statement, which is what an image or a tile table wants.

```basic
DIM INTEGER code(255), col(255)
COLOUR MAP code(), col()               ' the default palette
```

A third array replaces the palette for that call — it must be exactly
sixteen entries, and each must be a valid 24-bit colour:

```basic
DIM INTEGER pal(15)
FOR i = 0 TO 15 : pal(i) = RGB(i * 17, i * 17, i * 17) : NEXT i
COLOUR MAP code(), col(), pal()        ' sixteen greys instead
```

The two arrays must be the same size, and `in` and `out` may be the same
array — each element is read before it is written. The arrays are
integer; MMBasic accepts float ones as well, and here that is an error
rather than a silent conversion.

## Text on the picture: `TEXT` and `FONT`

`TEXT` puts a string at a pixel position, justified how you ask, in any
of nine fonts:

```basic
TEXT 160, 120, "Centred", "CM"
TEXT 319, 0, "top right", "RT", 3
TEXT 0, 100, "big and red", "LT", 5, 2, RGB(RED)
TEXT 0, 200, "over the picture", "LT", 1, 1, RGB(WHITE), -1
```

    TEXT x, y, string$ [, alignment$] [, font] [, scale] [, colour] [, background]

Everything after the string may be left out, and a blank argument takes
the default, as everywhere in MMBasic. `background` of `-1` is
transparent, which is how you write over a picture without a box of
paper around the letters. With no colours given, `COLOUR`'s are used.

`alignment$` is up to three letters and any of them may be omitted:

| | letters | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| horizontal | `L` `C` `R` | x is the left, the centre, the right |
| vertical | `T` `M` `B` | y is the top, the middle, the bottom |
| orientation | `N` `V` `I` `U` `D` | which way the characters face |

All five orientations draw. `N` is normal and `V` puts one character
per line downwards; the other three turn the character itself — `I`
upside down and running right to left, `U` a quarter turn
anticlockwise running upwards, `D` a quarter turn clockwise running
downwards.

Turning the character moves its cell, and that is worth knowing before
you place one. The `x, y` you give is the pixel the character would
have turned **about**, so it stays the top-left corner only for `N`
and `V`: for `I` it is the bottom-right, for `D` the top-right, and
for `U` the left edge just below the cell. Putting an upside-down
character where an upright one would have gone therefore means adding
the cell, not subtracting it:

```basic
Text 168, 30, "Y"                              ' upright, in that cell
Text 168 + MM.Info(FontWidth) - 1, _
     30 + MM.Info(FontHeight) - 1, "Y", "I"    ' upside down, same cell
```

`samples/textorient.bas` measures all five with `PIXEL()` and prints
the numbers, and carries the transcript a real PicoMite gives for the
same program.

The nine fonts are MMBasic's own, so a character looks the same here as
it does there. They live in the PC3's flash, which is why there is no
cost to having all of them:

| font | cell | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 8×12 | the console's own — the default |
| 2 | 12×20 | |
| 3 | 16×24 | |
| 4 | 10×16 | |
| 5 | 24×32 | |
| 6 | 32×50 | **digits only** — a clock face, a score |
| 7 | 6×8 | |
| 8 | 4×6 | the smallest |
| 9 | 8×10 | |

`scale` is 1 to 15 and multiplies the cell, so font 1 at scale 2 is a
16×24 character built from the 8×12 one.

A character a font does not have prints as a blank cell. With font 6
that is everything except `0` to `9`.

`FONT` sets the font `PRINT` itself uses, in a graphics mode:

```basic
FONT 3, 1
PRINT "large"
```

    FONT [#]n [, scale]

This changes where the next line goes as well as how the letters look —
a 24×32 font fills the screen in seven lines where font 1 takes
nineteen — and scrolling follows it.

## Your own font: `DefineFont`

A program can carry a font of its own and use it exactly like the nine
built-in ones:

```basic
FONT 10
TEXT 8, 8, "SCORE 1000", "LT", 10

DefineFont 10
  03300808
  FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF
  55AA55AA 55AA55AA
End DefineFont
```

The block may sit anywhere in the file — the bottom is the usual place,
as it is in MMBasic, and the font is in force from the first line of
the program whatever line it is written on.

**Numbers 10 to 16.** Fonts 1 to 9 are the built-in ones, shared with
the shell and every other program, so they cannot be replaced;
`DefineFont 9` is an error naming the range rather than a definition
that quietly does not happen. Ports of PicoMite programs that define a
low-numbered font need that one number changed.

The first word is the font describing itself and the rest are the
glyphs, in MMBasic's format, so a `DefineFont` block from a PicoMite
program can be pasted in unaltered:

| the first word, byte by byte | |
|---|---|
| width in pixels | height in pixels |
| code of the first character | how many characters |

Each group of eight hex digits is one 32-bit word, **least significant
byte first** — so `03300808` is width 8, height 8, first character
0x30 (`0`), three characters. Each glyph follows as width × height
bits, most significant bit leftmost, with no padding; width × height
must be a multiple of 8. A font is checked when the program is
translated, so a header that disagrees with the data it carries is a
translation error rather than a screen full of rubbish.

The glyphs live in the program and cost nothing else — the firmware is
handed their address, not a copy — and they go away with it. Another
program asking for font 10 gets its own, or nothing.

## The glyphs themselves: `MM.INFO(FONT ADDRESS)` and `PEEK` {#font-address}

`TEXT` draws on the PC3's own screen. If you have hung a display off
the I/O header — an ILI9341 on SPI, say — the firmware knows nothing
about it, and you are drawing every pixel yourself. You would rather
not also carry your own copy of a font to do it.

You do not have to. Ask where the built-in ones are:

```basic
a = MM.INFO(FONT ADDRESS 3)
```

That is a machine address, and on this computer a machine address is
something a program can simply read. There is no MMU and no memory
protection: the fonts are `const`, so they live in flash where nothing
can move them, and `PEEK` reaches them where they lie.

The first four bytes at that address are the font describing itself:

| offset | |
|---|---|
| 0 | width in pixels |
| 1 | height in pixels |
| 2 | code of the first character it has |
| 3 | how many characters |

so having the address you need nothing else — no table of sizes, no
constants of your own to get wrong:

```basic
w     = PEEK(BYTE a)
h     = PEEK(BYTE a + 1)
first = PEEK(BYTE a + 2)
count = PEEK(BYTE a + 3)
```

The glyphs follow, each `width × height` bits, packed continuously
with no padding between rows and no padding between characters, most
significant bit first. The one for character *c* starts at

    a + 4 + (c - first) * width * height / 8

and bit *y × width + x* of it is the pixel at (*x*, *y*). This is
MMBasic's own layout, unchanged, because these are MMBasic's own nine
fonts — the ones the console draws from.

Reading one back is the clearest way to see it. `fontaddr.bas` in
`/root/MMBasic` does exactly this, and prints:

```
font  address     cell   first  count
 1    1000EF10    8x12     32    224
 2    1000F994   12x20     32     95
 3    100104BC   16x24     32     95
 5    10012814   24x32     32     95
 6    10014BB8   32x50     48     11
```

Font 6 saying `first 48, count 11` is the digits-only font describing
itself: 48 is `"0"`, and eleven characters is `0` to `9` and one more.
Nothing in the program was told that.

    MM.INFO(FONT ADDRESS n)     n is 1 to 9; 0 if there is no such font
    PEEK(BYTE addr)             one unsigned byte
    PEEK(SHORT addr)            sixteen bits, signed
    PEEK(WORD addr)             thirty-two bits, unsigned
    PEEK(INTEGER addr)          sixty-four bits, signed
    PEEK(FLOAT addr)            a double

Both spellings are MMBasic's, so a program written this way runs on a
PicoMite unchanged.

**These are sharp.** A `PEEK` of a wrong address is not an error
message — there is nothing on this machine to catch it. It reads
whatever is there, or the program dies. Check the address you were
given before you use it:

```basic
a = MM.INFO(FONT ADDRESS 3)
IF a = 0 THEN ERROR "no font 3"
```

The wider forms insist the address is a multiple of their width, as
MMBasic does, and say `Address not divisible by 4` if it is not. That
is a real check and not a formality: an unaligned load faults on this
processor.

MMBasic's `PEEK(VAR ...)`, `PEEK(VARADDR ...)` and `PEEK(CFUNADDR ...)`
are not translated — those ask about a *variable* rather than an
address, which needs the symbol table. Neither is `POKE`, in any form.
What else `MM.INFO` answers is listed under
[Asking the machine about itself](#mm-info).

There is a worked example of all of this driving a real panel under
[A worked example: a barometric station](#qnh-example).

## Animation: `FRAMEBUFFER`

Drawing straight to the screen means the monitor shows the picture
half-finished — the erase, then each shape appearing in turn. MMBasic's
answer is to build the frame off-screen and show it in one go, and it
is here:

```basic
MODE 2
FRAMEBUFFER CREATE
FRAMEBUFFER WRITE F
DO
  CLS
  CIRCLE x, y, 20, , , 0, RGB(YELLOW)
  FRAMEBUFFER COPY F, N, B
LOOP WHILE INKEY$ = ""
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `FRAMEBUFFER CREATE` | make the off-screen buffer, blank |
| `FRAMEBUFFER LAYER` | make the layer, blank |
| `FRAMEBUFFER WRITE N` \| `F` \| `L` | send drawing to the screen, the buffer, or the layer |
| `FRAMEBUFFER COPY s, d [, B]` | `s` and `d` each `N`, `F` or `L`; `B` starts at the top of the frame |
| `FRAMEBUFFER MERGE [colour]` | the layer over the buffer, onto the screen |
| `FRAMEBUFFER CLOSE [F` \| `L]` | give one back |
| `FRAMEBUFFER WAIT` | wait for the top of the frame |

Everything that draws follows `WRITE`, `CLS` included — so `CLS` while
writing to `F` clears the buffer and leaves the picture on the screen
alone.

    CLS [colour]

fills whatever is being drawn on. With no colour it uses the background
from `COLOUR`, so `COLOUR RGB(WHITE), RGB(BLUE)` then `CLS` gives a blue
screen; `CLS RGB(GREEN)` fills with green without changing what `COLOUR`
set. Either way the text cursor goes back to the top left, as MMBasic's
does.

`CREATE` belongs **after** `MODE`. A mode change throws the buffer away,
because what is in it is in the geometry of the mode being left and
nothing converts it. That is MMBasic's rule too. You do not have to
`CLOSE`: the buffer comes back automatically when the program ends.

Only one program can hold the buffer at a time — a second one is told
so rather than quietly sharing it — and only the program holding it
draws into it. Anything else that draws while your program is between
frames, a shell prompt included, still goes to the screen.

**What it costs.** The buffer is in PSRAM, so drawing into it is about
2.4× the cost of drawing on the screen — a full-screen fill measured
1.49 ms direct against 3.63 ms buffered. The copy back is 38,400 bytes
at about 53 MB/s, or **0.73 ms**. So a redraw-and-show frame costs
somewhere near 4.4 ms against the 17 ms the display gives you, and
`COPY ... ,B` holds the loop to the refresh rate: 59 frames a second,
with room for roughly three times as much drawing before one is
dropped.

### The layer

`FRAMEBUFFER LAYER` makes a second off-screen buffer. It is the same
size and shape as `F` and you draw into it the same way, with
`FRAMEBUFFER WRITE L`; what makes it a *layer* is `MERGE`, which puts it
**on top**:

```basic
FRAMEBUFFER MERGE [colour]
```

lays the layer over `F` and shows the result, treating `colour` as
transparent — wherever the layer holds it, `F` shows through. Left out,
it is 0.

**A merge composites the layer over `F`, and nothing else.** The two
things it reads are `L` and `F`; the one thing it writes is the screen.
So a background drawn on `N` takes no part in the merge and is
*destroyed* by the first one — the screen becomes the layer over
whatever `F` holds, which for a program that never wrote to `F` is
blank. The symptom is not the missing background, which is the obvious
half; it is that the layer looks **opaque**. Where the transparent
colour keys through, what shows is blank `F`, and blank is black, so a
banner over an empty `F` looks exactly like a banner with no
transparency at all — and no value of `colour` from 0 to 15 changes
that, because the colour was never the problem. If a merge appears to
ignore transparency, check where the background went before checking
the colour.

**Neither source is changed by a merge.** That is the whole point of
having one: the background goes into `F` once, the thing that moves
goes into the layer, and a frame is one `CLS` of the layer, one shape,
and one `MERGE` — no repainting of everything underneath:

```basic
MODE 2
FRAMEBUFFER CREATE
FRAMEBUFFER LAYER

FRAMEBUFFER WRITE F                   ' the background, drawn once
CLS RGB(BLUE)
BOX 20, 20, 120, 80, 2, RGB(WHITE), RGB(RED)

FRAMEBUFFER WRITE N
DO
  FRAMEBUFFER WRITE L
  CLS 0                               ' 0 is the transparent index
  CIRCLE x, 120, 30, 2, 1, RGB(YELLOW), RGB(YELLOW)
  FRAMEBUFFER WRITE N
  FRAMEBUFFER MERGE 0
  x = x + 4
LOOP WHILE INKEY$ = ""
```

`COPY` takes `L` at either end, so `COPY F, L` puts the background into
the layer to draw over, and `COPY L, N` shows the layer on its own.
`CLOSE L` gives it back; so does the end of the program.

**The transparent colour means what it means in the mode you are in.**
In `MODE 2` a pixel is four bits, so it is a colour index from 0 to 15
and the merge keys on it per pixel. In `MODE 1` a pixel is one bit:
transparent 0 means the layer's set pixels paint and its clear ones let
`F` through, and transparent 1 is the other way round. Same command,
same program, and `MODE 1` is the faster of the two.

**What it costs.** A merge waits for the top of the frame first, always
— it writes into the buffer being scanned out, and starting part way
down tears the picture once per merge. In `MODE 2` the loop above runs
at **16.62 ms a frame, 60 frames a second**, of which the drawing is
2.57 ms; the rest is the composite and the wait it is hidden behind. It
is quantised by that wait, so a little more drawing costs nothing at
all and too much costs a whole frame.

`MERGE` needs both buffers and says so — "Layer not created" if there
is no layer, "Frame buffer not created" if there is no `F` — rather
than doing half of it.

This is MMBasic's TFT model, the one its ILI9341 builds use, so a
program written for a PicoMite with a panel on it runs here unchanged.
Its VGA and HDMI builds do the same compositing inside the scanline
builder instead, continuously and without a command; that needs every
buffer in the RAM the display DMAs from, which on this machine is 40K
taken off every program forever, whether it uses a layer or not. The
reasoning is written out in `PC3-LAYER-MERGE.md` in the source tree.

`INKEY$` returns the key that has been pressed, or `""` if none has,
without waiting — which is how the loop above ends. It leaves the
terminal as it found it, so `INPUT` still works afterwards and a
program stopped with Ctrl-C does not take the shell's echo with it.

A cursor or function key reaches a terminal as an escape sequence of
several bytes, and `INKEY$` reassembles it and gives back the single
code MMBasic gives, so the PicoMite idiom works unchanged:

```basic
DO
  k$ = INKEY$
  IF k$ = CHR$(&H80) THEN PRINT "up"
  IF k$ = CHR$(&H91) THEN PRINT "F1"
LOOP UNTIL k$ = "q"
```

The codes are MMBasic's: `&H80`–`&H83` for up, down, left and right,
`&H84` insert, `&H86` home, `&H87` end, `&H88`/`&H89` page up and
down, `&H7F` delete, and `&H91`–`&H9C` for F1 to F12. A sequence it
does not recognise comes back byte by byte behind its escape, so
nothing is lost — and a bare `ESC` is still `CHR$(27)`.

## Tiles and their sprites: `TILEMAP`

A tile game draws its world from a grid of small pictures — the
tileset — and a map that says which tile goes where. MMBasic's
`TILEMAP` does that drawing in one statement, keeps the map in two
bytes a cell, and carries its own sprites for the things that move over
it. It is here complete: the command, the function, and `FLASH LOAD
IMAGE` to put the tileset where it looks for it. The PicoMite's own
Breakout runs unedited (`samples/breakout.bas`).

The tileset is a BMP in a flash slot, and the map is `DATA`:

```basic
MODE 2
FLASH LOAD IMAGE 1, "tiles.bmp", O          ' the tileset, into slot 1
TILEMAP CREATE mapdata, 1, 1, 16, 16, 8, 20, 15
TILEMAP ATTR tileattrs, 1, 8
TILEMAP SPRITE CREATE 1, 1, 7, 160, 120     ' the player is tile 7
FRAMEBUFFER CREATE
DO
  FRAMEBUFFER WRITE F
  CLS
  TILEMAP DRAW 1, F, camx, camy, 0, 0, 320, 240
  TILEMAP SPRITE DRAW F, 0
  FRAMEBUFFER COPY F, N
LOOP UNTIL INKEY$ = "q"
TILEMAP CLOSE
END

mapdata:
DATA 5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
DATA 5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5
' ... 20 columns by 15 rows
tileattrs:
DATA 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `TILEMAP CREATE label, id, slot, tw, th, tpr, cols, rows` | map `id` (1–4) from the `DATA` at `label`: `cols`×`rows` tile numbers, row by row; tiles `tw`×`th` pixels, `tpr` of them across the image in `slot` |
| `TILEMAP ATTR label, id, n` | `n` attribute words from the `DATA` at `label`, one per tile TYPE — tile 1 first |
| `TILEMAP SET id, col, row, tile` | change one cell (0-based column and row) |
| `TILEMAP DRAW id, dest, vx, vy, sx, sy, vw, vh [, t]` | draw the tiles under the `vw`×`vh` window at world pixel `vx, vy`, with its corner at `sx, sy` on `N`, `F` or `L`; `t` is a colour index (0–15) to see through, -1 for none |
| `TILEMAP SCROLL id, dx, dy` | move the remembered viewport, clamped to the world |
| `TILEMAP VIEW id, x, y` | set it outright |
| `TILEMAP DESTROY id` | free one map; `TILEMAP CLOSE` frees them all, sprites too |
| `TILEMAP SPRITE CREATE id, map, tile, x, y` | sprite `id` (1–64) showing `tile` from `map`'s tileset at pixel `x, y` |
| `TILEMAP SPRITE MOVE id, x, y` | move it |
| `TILEMAP SPRITE SET id, tile` | change its picture — animation |
| `TILEMAP SPRITE DRAW dest, t` | draw every sprite, in slot order, so a higher number lands on top |
| `TILEMAP SPRITE DESTROY id` | free one; `TILEMAP SPRITE CLOSE` frees them all |

The function answers questions about the same things:

| | |
|---|---|
| `TILEMAP(TILE id, x, y)` | the tile number under world pixel `x, y`; 0 off the map |
| `TILEMAP(COLLISION id, x, y, w, h [, mask])` | the first non-empty tile under the box, or 0; with `mask`, only a tile whose attribute has one of those bits |
| `TILEMAP(ATTR id, tile)` | the attribute word of a tile type; 0 if none was given |
| `TILEMAP(VIEWX id)`, `TILEMAP(VIEWY id)` | where the viewport is |
| `TILEMAP(COLS id)`, `TILEMAP(ROWS id)` | how big the map is |
| `TILEMAP(SPRITE X id)`, `(SPRITE Y id)`, `(SPRITE TILE id)` | a sprite's position and picture |
| `TILEMAP(SPRITE W id)`, `(SPRITE H id)` | its size — the tile size of its map |
| `TILEMAP(SPRITE HIT a, b)` | 1 if the two sprites' boxes overlap |

The rules are MMBasic's, and three of them are worth knowing before
they surprise you:

* **Tile numbers count from 1, and 0 is empty.** Tile 1 is the
  top-left of the tileset, 2 the next to its right, wrapping after
  `tpr`. A 0 in the map draws nothing and leaves what was underneath.
* **The viewport chooses tiles, it does not clip them.** Every tile
  the `vw`×`vh` window touches is drawn whole, clipped only at the edge
  of the screen — a 100-pixel window over 16-pixel tiles paints seven
  tiles across. A game draws a whole screen and never notices; if you
  want a hard-edged window, draw into `F` and `BLIT FRAMEBUFFER` the
  rectangle you want.
* **The `label` comes first.** `TILEMAP CREATE mapdata, 1, ...` — the
  label names the `DATA` lines the map is read from, and the values
  run on from there through whatever `DATA` follows, so a map short of
  values takes them from the next table rather than failing. Your own
  `READ` position is not moved, and a `DATA` item that names a
  `CONST` (`DATA SOLID`, the way MMBasic's own TILEMAP examples write
  their attribute tables) reads as its value, as MMBasic's `READ`
  does — wherever in the program the `CONST` is declared.

Every `TILEMAP` statement wants an RGB121 screen (`MODE 2`); in `MODE
1` it says so, as MMBasic does. The map lives in memory as long as
the program runs, and `TILEMAP CLOSE` at the end is manners rather
than a necessity.

### `FLASH LOAD IMAGE`

    FLASH LOAD IMAGE n, file$ [, O]

decodes a BMP into flash slot `n` (1–3) in the layout `TILEMAP` and
`BLIT FLASH` read. Without `O` a slot that already holds something is
"Already programmed", as on a PicoMite; `FLASH ERASE n` clears it. The
colours are reduced the way the sprite loaders reduce them — red's top
bit, green's top two, blue's top bit — so a tileset drawn in saturated
colours arrives as you drew it, and one made on the machine with `SAVE
IMAGE` (which is how Breakout makes its bricks) round-trips exactly.
The decoding is `loadimage`'s, in another process, so a program that
never loads a picture carries none of it.

## Running another program: `SYSTEM`, `SAVE IMAGE`, `LOAD IMAGE`, `LOAD JPG`, `LOAD PNG`

`SYSTEM` runs a program and waits for it:

```basic
SYSTEM "sum", "a.bmp", "b.bmp"
```

Each argument is passed separately, so no shell quoting is involved
and a filename with a space in it needs no special care.

`SAVE IMAGE` and `LOAD IMAGE` are built on it — they run the
`saveimage` and `loadimage` programs described in the applications
list, which means a BASIC program that never touches an image pays
nothing for them:

```basic
SAVE IMAGE "shot.bmp"                      ' the whole screen
SAVE IMAGE "part.bmp", 160, 120, 320, 240  ' x, y, w, h
LOAD IMAGE "shot.bmp"                      ' at 0,0
LOAD IMAGE "shot.bmp", 160, 120            ' at x,y
LOAD IMAGE "shot"                          ' .bmp is added for you
```

A name with **no extension** gets `.bmp`, as MMBasic's
`AppendDefaultExtension` does, so a program written for a PicoMite
needs no edit. A dot inside a directory name does not count — only the
last part of the path is looked at. The same rule serves `SPRITE
LOADBMP` and `BLIT LOAD`.

`LOAD IMAGE` takes MMBasic's full syntax including the dither mode and
the source rectangle:

```
LOAD IMAGE fname$ [,x] [,y] [,mode] [,ximage] [,yimage] [,wimage] [,himage]
```

The decoder is MMBasic's, so it reads 1, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 32-bit BMPs,
`BI_BITFIELDS`, and RLE4/RLE8 compression. Dithering is *optional*, as
in MMBasic — omit the mode and the image is mapped without it.

`LOAD BMP` is accepted as a synonym for `LOAD IMAGE`, as in the
reference.

### `LOAD JPG`

```
LOAD JPG fname$ [,x] [,y] [,mode] [,ximage] [,yimage] [,scale]
```

MMBasic's own picojpeg, as the `loadjpg` program. `scale` is 1, 2, 4 or
8 and bins that many source pixels into one on screen, so a photograph
larger than the display can be fitted to it. `ximage`/`yimage` take a
region out of the middle of a larger picture.

Binning costs nothing extra: every MCU still has to be decoded, because
a JPEG stream cannot be seeked into — only the drawing is reduced. A
320×240 photograph draws in about 0.45 s either way.

`mode` is the dither argument. It is *parsed and ignored*, for the
reason given under `LOAD IMAGE`: error diffusion wants rows of signed
error per channel, and this program runs while your BASIC program is
still resident in memory.

### `LOAD PNG`

```
LOAD PNG fname$ [,x] [,y] [,transparent] [,cutoff]
```

MMBasic's own upng, as the `loadpng` program.

**`transparent` decides what happens to see-through pixels, and its
default will surprise you the first time.** As in the reference it
defaults to **0**, which is the palette's black — so a PNG with a
transparent surround lands on screen inside a black box. That is what a
PicoMite does, and it is deliberate: the same default is what makes
`SPRITE LOADPNG` work (see below). To let the screen show through
instead, pass **-1**:

```basic
CLS RGB(255,255,255)
LOAD PNG "apple.png", 0, 0, -1     ' the white shows through
LOAD PNG "apple.png"               ' a black box around it
```

`cutoff` is the alpha value above which a pixel counts as opaque, 1 to
254, default 20.

Note that an *opaque* black pixel is drawn black whichever you choose —
nothing can tell "background" from "black" once the alpha channel says
opaque. If a picture has an unwanted dark surround even with `-1`, the
file has an opaque background rather than an alpha one.

`LOAD PNG` needs the PSRAM arena and says so if a kernel cannot provide
one. PNG cannot be decoded a piece at a time — its filters refer to the
row above and its compressed stream is one window over the whole image —
so the entire picture is inflated before any of it can be drawn: about
300 KB for a full screen, twice the whole process pool. The reference
has the same constraint and offers `LOAD PNG` only on RP2350 for it.

## Music: `PLAY MP3`, `PLAY WAV`, `PLAY FLAC`, `PLAY SOUND`, `PLAY TONE`, `PLAY MODFILE` {#music}

```basic
PLAY VOLUME 70
PLAY MP3 "/root/mp3/whiter.mp3"
' the program carries straight on, and the music plays
FOR i% = 1 TO 20
  PRINT "still working"; i%
  PAUSE 500
NEXT i%
PLAY STOP
```

`PLAY MP3` does **not** wait. The decoder is a separate program feeding
a 1.5-second buffer in the kernel, and the sound hardware empties that
buffer by DMA, so playback needs nothing from your program once it has
started. MMBasic has to refill its audio from the interpreter's idle
loop; here there is no idle loop to do it in, and no cost when there is
nothing to play. A translated benchmark measured **89% of its full
speed** with a track playing.

`PLAY WAV` and `PLAY FLAC` are the same statement with a different
decoder behind it, and behave the same way in every respect — they do
not wait, `PLAY STOP` stops them, and `PLAY VOLUME` sets their level.
WAV covers 8, 16, 24 and 32-bit PCM, IEEE float, A-law and mu-law, all
converted to the 16 bits the hardware takes. FLAC is read at its own
rate and bit depth; a 44.1 kHz 16-bit stereo file plays with no
underruns while the machine is otherwise idle.

One thing to know about FLAC in particular: its decoder is sized from
the file, at roughly `maxBlockSize x 4 x channels`, so a file written
with 4096-sample blocks wants about 32K and one written with 16384
wants about 132K — out of a pool of 336K shared with everything else
running. A file that will not open says so, and says how much it
wanted, rather than failing silently.

All three take an optional **completion interrupt**, as `PLAY MODFILE`
does:

```basic
PLAY WAV "/root/chime.wav", Finished
' ... the program carries straight on ...
SUB Finished
  PRINT "that's the end of it"
END SUB
```

The handler runs when the file ends, and on `PLAY STOP` as well.

**It is not instant, and the two cases differ.** At the end of a file it
arrives about a third of a second after the last sound, which is the
buffer draining. After `PLAY STOP` it takes **about a second**: the
player holds the sound hardware until its buffer has drained and it has
exited, and the handler fires on the hardware coming free rather than on
the statement. Measured on this machine, a five-second file: end of file
at 5.30 s, and a `PLAY STOP` at 3.79 s answered at 4.80 s. MMBasic
answers a `STOP` at once, so a program ported from one that leans on
that will feel the difference.

Stopping a file in its **first two seconds** is later still - about 2.3
seconds from the `PLAY` - because the watch has not yet seen the player
take the hardware and waits out the two seconds it allows for that. The
same two seconds are what a file that will not open costs: nothing takes
the hardware, and the handler fires anyway, because by then the sound is
certainly over.

`PLAY VOLUME n` takes 0 to 100 and is remembered, so every later
`PLAY MP3`, `PLAY WAV` or `PLAY FLAC` uses it until it is changed
again. Out-of-range values are clamped rather than refused. The default
is 80. The scale is logarithmic, so 50 is a comfortable half rather
than a whisper.

`PLAY STOP` stops whatever is playing. It asks the kernel which
process holds the sound output rather than remembering what it started,
so it also stops a player left running by a program that was stopped
with Ctrl-C — which is the situation it is most often wanted for.
Stopping when nothing is playing is not an error, as in MMBasic.

There is one sound output, so there is one player:

```
Error: sound output in use
```

is what `PLAY MP3` gives if something is already playing. Use
`PLAY STOP` first. (This is MMBasic's "Sound output in use for ..."
under a shorter name.) The rule is enforced by the kernel rather than
by convention: two decoders writing into the same buffer interleave
their samples, and it sounds like it.

Files play at their own sample rate — 8 kHz to 48 kHz, mono or stereo,
and a mono file costs nothing extra because the driver duplicates the
channels itself. Copy MP3s onto the FAT partition from a PC and bring
them over with `fat get`, as with any other file.

`PLAY` and BBC BASIC's `SOUND` share one piece of hardware and are
mutually exclusive, exactly as they are in MMBasic. Starting a track
silences the synthesiser; stopping it hands the hardware back.

### The synthesiser: `PLAY SOUND` and `PLAY TONE`

```basic
PLAY SOUND 1, B, S, 440, 15     ' voice 1, both sides, sine, 440 Hz
PLAY SOUND 2, B, Q, 220, 10     ' a square underneath it
PAUSE 1000
PLAY SOUND 1, B, O              ' voice 1 off
PLAY TONE 440, 554, 600         ' left/right pair for 600 ms
```

MMBasic's four-voice synthesiser, rendered by the kernel itself in the
audio interrupt that drives the DAC — the same place MMBasic renders
it. Four voices, each with an independent left
and right side; channels are `L`, `R`, `B` or `M`, and the types are
`S`ine, `Q` (square), `T`riangle, `W` (sawtooth), `P`eriodic noise,
`N` (white noise) and `O`ff. Frequency is 1 Hz to 20 kHz, volume 0 to
25. `PLAY TONE` takes left and right frequencies and an optional
duration in milliseconds, rounded down to whole cycles as MMBasic
rounds it; no duration means until further notice. The square and
sawtooth are band-limited (polyBLEP), so they hold a pure pitch at
the top of the range instead of shimmering.

Channel and type may be written as a bare letter, a quoted letter or a
string worked out at run time, as MMBasic writes them: `PLAY SOUND 1,
B, S, 440`, `PLAY SOUND 1, "B", "S", 440` and `PLAY SOUND 1, c$, t$,
440` are the same statement.

**A change of note is heard at once.** Until v0.15 the synthesiser was
a separate program rendering ahead into a queue, which put a fifth of
a second between the statement and the sound — audible as lag in a
game, and the reason a program changing pitch every 20 ms could not
work at all. It now runs where MMBasic runs it, in the interrupt that
feeds the DAC, so a `PLAY SOUND` is in the next buffer the hardware
asks for: under two milliseconds. The voices go quiet by themselves
after five seconds with every voice off, or on `PLAY STOP`, and a
program that ends — including one stopped with `Ctrl-C` — takes its
sound with it.

### Modules: `PLAY MODFILE` and `PLAY MODSAMPLE`

```basic
PLAY MODFILE "/root/ptetris.mod"
PAUSE 5000
PLAY MODSAMPLE 3, 4             ' fire sample 3 on channel 4, over the music
PLAY STOP
```

`PLAY MODFILE` plays ProTracker modules at 22 kHz through the hxcmod
tracker, the whole file staged in PSRAM. Like MP3 it runs as its own
program and does not wait. `PLAY MODSAMPLE n, ch [, vol]` asks the
*running* player to mix one of the module's own samples over the
music - MMBasic's game sound-effect trick - with nothing loaded and
nothing interrupted. With a completion interrupt the module plays
once; otherwise it loops until `PLAY STOP`.

## Pins: `SETPIN` and `PIN`

```basic
SETPIN 2, DOUT
SETPIN 3, DIN
PIN(2) = 1
IF PIN(3) = 1 THEN PRINT "high"

SETPIN 41, AIN                  ' analogue, in volts
PRINT PIN(41)                   '   1.677936508
SETPIN 41, ARAW                 ' analogue, raw
PRINT PIN(41)                   '   2090
```

All **forty-eight** GPIOs of the RP2350B are available — the wider part
is why the PC3 can put the real-time clock's alarm on GP32, which a
28-pin RP2040 could not reach.

**A pin is a register access, not a system call** — about ten
nanoseconds against the 1.5 microseconds a crossing into the kernel
costs. That is what makes bit-banging a protocol from BASIC possible at
all, and it is why `ONEWIRE` and the rest are written in your own
program's time rather than as kernel drivers. The kernel still owns the
pin: `SETPIN` claims it, claiming one another program holds is refused,
and the claim is released — with the pin **reset to an input** — when
your program ends, however it ends. A program that dies driving a relay
does not leave it driven.

`n` is the **GPIO number**, not MMBasic's connector-pin numbering. The
GPIO number is what the schematic, the kernel, and every other tool on
this machine use, and inventing a second numbering for one statement
would cause more confusion than the incompatibility does.

`SETPIN` takes:

| mode | what the pin becomes |
|---|---|
| `DIN`  | a digital input |
| `DOUT` | a digital output, driven by `PIN(n) = v` |
| `AIN`  | an analogue input read as **volts** |
| `ARAW` | an analogue input read as the **raw 0–4095 count** |
| `INTH` | a digital input that calls a SUB on a **low-to-high** edge |
| `INTL` | … on a **high-to-low** edge |
| `INTB` | … on **either** edge |
| `PWM`  | a PWM output, driven by the `PWM` statement |
| `FIN`  | a **frequency** input — `PIN()` answers in Hz |
| `CIN`  | a **counting** input — `PIN()` is the live edge count |
| `PIN`  | a **period** input — `PIN()` answers in milliseconds |
| `OFF`  | not configured |

The three counting modes have their own section below; they are the
one family that works on **GP4–GP7 only**.

Input modes take MMBasic's optional pull:

```basic
SETPIN 2, DIN, PULLUP
SETPIN 3, DIN, PULLDOWN
SETPIN 35, INTL, Pressed, PULLUP      ' after the handler
```

Absent means neither, which is MMBasic's default — a floating input then
reads whatever the wire is doing, and with nothing connected that is
noise. A switch to ground wants `PULLUP`.

**Hysteresis is always on for inputs.** It is not an option in MMBasic
either: every digital input it configures gets the Schmitt trigger, and
so does every one here. On a board with header pins and flying leads a
slow or noisy edge is the normal case.

`AIN` and `ARAW` need an ADC pin: on the RP2350B channel *n* is
GP40+*n*, so **GP40–GP46** on the I/O header. Anything else gives
`Pin cannot do that`.

The two analogue modes differ only in what `PIN()` gives back. `ARAW`
is a single conversion, which is what you want when you are going to do
your own filtering or you care about speed. `AIN` is MMBasic's filter,
step for step: ten readings, sorted, the top two and bottom two thrown
away, and the remaining six averaged and scaled by 3.3 V. The point of
it is the *discard* — one wild sample is dropped rather than smeared
across the answer, which plain averaging would do. (MMBasic's
`OPTION VCC` is not supported, so the scale is always 3.3 V.)

`PIN()` returns a **float in every mode**, where MMBasic returns an
integer for digital pins and `ARAW`. Nothing observable changes —
`PRINT PIN(2)` still prints `1`, and comparisons and array indices
behave the same — because a double holds 0, 1 and every 12-bit count
exactly. The reason is that translated C has to know the type when it
is generated, and nothing at that point knows what mode a pin will be
in.

### The counting inputs: `FIN`, `CIN` and `PIN`

```basic
SETPIN 4, FIN                ' frequency, 1-second gate
SETPIN 4, FIN, 100           ' … over a 100 ms gate
SETPIN 4, CIN                ' count rising edges
SETPIN 4, CIN, 3             ' … count both edges
SETPIN 4, PIN                ' period of one cycle, in ms
SETPIN 4, PIN, 50            ' … averaged over 50 cycles
PRINT PIN(4)
PIN(4) = 0                   ' CIN only: zero (or set) the count
```

These count **edges in hardware**, in an interrupt, which is why they
are the one pin family whose work lives in the kernel rather than in
your program — a poll at statement speed would miss pulses and is not
pretended. The count pins are **fixed: GP4–GP7**, this machine's
version of MMBasic's four `OPTION COUNT` pins (`OPTION COUNT` itself,
which *moves* them, is refused by name). Any other pin gives `Pin
cannot do that`.

The semantics are MMBasic's exactly:

* **`FIN [, gate]`** — rising edges are counted over a repeating
  *gate* (1–100000 ms, default 1000), and `PIN()` returns the last
  **completed** gate's count scaled to Hz. The reading updates once
  per gate and is **0 until the first gate completes**. A short gate
  answers sooner but in coarser steps: at `100` the answer moves in
  10 Hz steps.
* **`CIN [, option]`** — `PIN()` is the **live** 64-bit count.
  `PIN(n) = v` stores *v* into the counter — any value, though `0` is
  the one every program uses. *option*: 1 counts rising edges
  (default), 2 falling, 3 both; 1 and 4 add a pull-down, 2 and 5 a
  pull-up.
* **`PIN [, cycles]`** — the period, in **milliseconds**, averaged
  over *cycles* (1–10000, default 1). Yes, the mode word is `PIN` —
  that is MMBasic's own spelling. Note the default of 1 cycle carries
  a pull-down, as it does on a PicoMite.

`SETPIN n, OFF`, any reconfiguration, or your program ending — however
it ends — stops the counting and returns the pin to ordinary duty.

Measured on this machine against its own PWM (the two share a crystal,
so the figures are exact, not approximate): `FIN` reads 1000.0 at
1 kHz on the default gate and tracks 100 kHz exactly; a 100 kHz input
costs the machine nothing you can measure from BASIC (the same busy
loop timed 10.22 ms under 1 kHz of edges and 10.25 ms under 100 kHz);
and counting loses nothing while `PLAY SOUND` runs. The edge handler
and its dispatcher run from RAM for exactly that reason.

### Measuring a pulse: `Pulsin(` and `Distance(` {#pulsin}

> **The measured pin must be GP4, GP5, GP6 or GP7.** Nothing else can
> be measured: another pin gives `Pulsin needs GP4, GP5, GP6 or GP7`
> at translate-run time rather than a wrong number. For `DISTANCE` the
> restriction is on the **echo** pin only — the trigger may be any
> header pin. It is the same fixed set the counting inputs use, and for
> the same reason: these are the pins whose interrupt the kernel owns.

```basic
SETPIN GP5, DIN
w = PULSIN(GP5, 1)              ' the next HIGH pulse, in microseconds
w = PULSIN(GP5, 0, 5000)        ' the next LOW one, giving up after 5 ms
d = DISTANCE(GP1, GP7)          ' HC-SR04: trigger any pin, echo GP4-GP7
d = DISTANCE(GP4)               ' ... or a 3-pin device on one wire
```

`PULSIN(pin, polarity [, t1 [, t2]])` returns the width in
microseconds, or **-1** if it timed out. `t1` bounds the wait for the
pulse to start and `t2` the pulse itself; both default to 100 ms and
both may be 5 µs to 10 seconds. `DISTANCE(trig [, echo])` returns
centimetres, **-1** if no echo came back and **-2** if the sensor never
answered at all.

#### Why the pins are fixed

MMBasic measures a pulse by spinning on the pin and a microsecond
clock, which is the right answer on a machine running one program. It
is not the right answer here, and the measurement says so: a spin loop
on this machine is interrupted for 14–18 µs about 345 times a second by
the system tick alone, and **the moment a second program is runnable
the scheduler takes the measuring loop off the CPU for half a second**.
A pulse measured across that is not slightly wrong, it is meaningless —
and nothing in a BASIC program could tell.

So the kernel timestamps both edges in the interrupt that already
serves the counting inputs, and `PULSIN` reads the times rather than
watching the pin. Your program can be as late as the machine makes it
and still get the right answer; what is left is the interrupt latency,
under a microsecond normally. **That interrupt exists on GP4–GP7 and
nowhere else, which is exactly where the pin restriction comes from.**
A version that worked on any pin would have to go back to spinning, and
would be right when the machine was idle and wrong when it was busy.

Measured against the board's own PWM, a 250 µs pulse reads 250 µs every
time — **and reads 250 µs while another program spins flat out**. An
HC-SR04 on GP1/GP7 reads a reflector at 20 cm as 21.5 cm, fifteen
readings without a flicker, and the same fifteen under that same load.

#### Three more things to know

* `PULSIN` and `DISTANCE` use the same hardware as
  `SETPIN ... FIN/CIN/PIN`, so a pin cannot be a counter and a pulse
  measurement at once, and **one pin at a time** is being measured.
* A pin so noisy that more than sixteen edges arrive between two looks
  gets **-1** rather than a guess.
* A sensor that answers oddly is worth believing. `DISTANCE` returning
  a small constant means the echo line really is that short: on the
  bench that turned out to be a 5 V module given 3.3 V on its trigger,
  and the reading was correct about a wire that was wrong.

**Pins are now owned.** `SETPIN` claims the pin from the kernel, and
claiming one that another program holds gives `Pin cannot do that`
rather than quietly fighting over it. The claim is released — and the
pin **reset to an input** — when your program ends, however it ends,
including being killed or crashing. So a program that dies driving a
relay does not leave it driven.

Only the I/O header can be claimed: **GP0–GP7, GP26 and GP34–GP46**,
plus **GP32**. The rest belong to the board (display, SD card, PSRAM,
sound, console, the DS3231's I2C), and asking for one gives `Pin cannot
do that` instead of taking a pin the audio hardware is driving. Appendix
A lists what the board uses. A pin number outside 0–47 gives `Invalid
pin`.

GP32 is not on the header — it is the **DS3231's alarm output**, and an
alarm nothing can read is not an alarm. It is open-drain and active low,
so with a pull-up it reads 1 until the alarm asserts:

```basic
SETPIN 32, DIN, PULLUP
PRINT PIN(32)                     ' 1 = not asserted

SETPIN 32, INTL, WakeUp, PULLUP   ' fires when it does assert
```

### Arming the alarm

MMBasic has no alarm command — a program writes the chip's registers,
and so does this:

```basic
SUB Alarm
  hits = hits + 1
  RTC SETREG 15, 0            ' clear the flag, or it never fires again
END SUB

RTC SETREG 7, 128             ' alarm 1 masks: match nothing = every second
RTC SETREG 8, 128
RTC SETREG 9, 128
RTC SETREG 10, 128
RTC SETREG 15, 0              ' clear any stale flag
RTC SETREG 14, 5              ' INTCN | A1IE - drive INT, enable alarm 1

SETPIN 32, INTL, Alarm, PULLUP
```

`RTC GETREG reg, var` and `RTC SETREG reg, value` reach any of the
DS3231's registers, which is MMBasic's own interface (it has `GETREG`
and `SETREG` and no alarm command). Register 7–10 are alarm 1, 0x0E is
control, 0x0F is status. The chip's data sheet is the reference.

**Your handler must clear the alarm flag.** The INT line stays low until
it is, so an alarm that does not clear it fires once and then looks
broken.

Two things this cannot do. It will not stop the oscillator — a write to
the control register comes back with `EOSC` masked out, because on a
battery-backed part a stopped clock outlives the power cycle and the
machine boots not knowing the time. And it is not `/dev/i2c`: that
driver refuses address 0x68 outright, so this goes through the kernel's
own path to the chip, sharing the retry and recovery the system clock
already relies on.

On a **Pico Computer 2** GP32 is the SD card's MISO instead, so the same
kernel refuses to hand it out there — the board tells itself apart at
boot. This is the one pin whose availability depends on which machine
you are running on.

`PIN(n) = v` on a pin that is not a `DOUT` gives `Pin is not an
output`, and reading a pin that has never been `SETPIN`ed gives `Pin is
not an input` — both as MMBasic does.

Pin work no longer costs a system call. `SETPIN` makes one, once, to
claim; after that `PIN(n)` and `PIN(n) = v` are single register
accesses, about ten nanoseconds against the 1.5 µs an ioctl costs.
That is what makes bit-banging a protocol in BASIC possible at all —
and it is not a theoretical claim: `ONEWIRE` is bit-banged that way,
in slots of 60 µs with a 10 µs sample point inside them, which an
ioctl per edge could not have fitted twice over.

## Pin interrupts

```basic
SUB Pressed
  PRINT "GP35 went ";PIN(35)
END SUB

SETPIN 35, INTB, Pressed         ' either edge
DO
  ' ... ordinary work; the handler runs between statements
LOOP
```

The handler is an ordinary `SUB` taking no parameters, and it ends with
`END SUB`. **There is no `IRETURN` to write** — that is MMBasic's
behaviour too, not a simplification: for a SUB target MMBasic builds an
`IRETURN` of its own and uses it as the return address of the `GOSUB` it
fakes, so `END SUB` performs the interrupt return. Written `IRETURN`
only ever existed for targets given as a label or a line number, and
those are not translated: compiled code cannot jump into the middle of a
function, so a label or line number is refused with a clear message
rather than half-working.

**These are not hardware interrupts, and they are not in MMBasic
either.** The whole facility is a poll. MMBasic's interpreter checks
after every statement, and pin "interrupts" there are a comparison of
the pin's level against its level at the previous check — there is no
GPIO IRQ anywhere in it. This does the same thing at the same place, so
the behaviour you get is the behaviour a PicoMite gives:

* **Latency is one statement**, and a statement is atomic. Nothing ever
  runs half a statement of your program.
* **A pulse shorter than a statement is missed.** That is MMBasic's
  documented limitation, replicated rather than "fixed".
* **Interrupts never nest.** A handler's own statements are polled, but
  the poll does nothing while a handler is running.
* **One handler runs per statement boundary.** If two pins change at
  once, the second fires at the next statement.
* `MM.ERRNO` and `MM.ERRMSG$` are **saved, cleared and restored** around
  a handler, so a handler starts clean and cannot leave an error behind
  for the interrupted code to trip over.

Up to ten pins may have interrupts, which is MMBasic's own limit. The
level a handler reads with `PIN(n)` is the level *now*, not the level
that triggered it — with a mechanical switch the two often differ,
because contacts bounce faster than the handler starts. MMBasic reads it
the same way.

A program that arms no interrupt pays nothing at all: the per-statement
poll is emitted only for programs that use the feature, exactly as the
`ON ERROR` checks are.

## `PWM`

```basic
SETPIN 0, PWM                ' GP0 is slice 0, channel A
PWM 0, 1000, 25              ' slice 0: 1 kHz, 25% on channel A
PWM 0, 1000, 25, 75          ' ...and 75% on channel B
PWM 0, 1000, -25             ' negative duty = inverted output
PWM 0, OFF
```

`SETPIN pin, PWM` attaches a pin to its PWM output; the `PWM` statement
then drives the **slice**, not the pin. One slice has two channels and
drives two pins, which is why the two commands are separate — the same
split MMBasic uses.

Which slice a pin belongs to is arithmetic: pins below GP32 use slice
`(pin ÷ 2) MOD 8`, and GP32 upward use `8 + ((pin ÷ 2) MOD 4)`. Even
pins are channel A, odd pins channel B. **Twelve slices cover
forty-eight pins, so pins alias**: GP34 and GP42 are the same slice and
channel, and setting one sets the other. `SETPIN pin, PWM` claims the
slice as well as the pin, so a second program asking for a pin that
lands on a slice you hold is told `Pin cannot do that` rather than
quietly changing your frequency.

Frequency is in Hz and duty in percent, and the range is wide: 100 kHz
and 50 Hz both work. Below about 5.7 kHz the 16-bit counter cannot hold
a whole period at 375 MHz, so the clock divider takes up the slack —
that happens automatically, and the only sign of it is that very low
frequencies have coarser duty resolution. Asking for something the
divider cannot reach either gives `Invalid frequency`.

A **negative duty** inverts that channel's output: `-25` is 25% inverted,
so the pin reads high 75% of the time. It is the channel's polarity bit,
not a recomputed duty.

`PIN()` will not read a PWM pin — it is an output, and MMBasic refuses it
too.

**Giving only one duty leaves the other channel alone.** That is not a
detail: two outputs share a slice, so `PWM 0, 1000, 25` must not stop
whatever is running on channel B.

## `SERVO`

```basic
SETPIN 0, PWM
SERVO 0, 50                  ' centre
SERVO 0, 0, 100              ' two servos on one slice, opposite ends
SERVO 0, OFF
```

A servo is PWM at a fixed 50 Hz frame with the position expressed as a
pulse width, so `SERVO` is `PWM` with one line of arithmetic in front of
it — MMBasic's:

| position | pulse | |
|---|---|---|
| `0`   | 1.0 ms | one end |
| `50`  | 1.5 ms | centre |
| `100` | 2.0 ms | the other end |
| `-20` | 0.8 ms | over-travel |
| `120` | 2.2 ms | over-travel |

The range is -20 to 120, which is the over-travel most servos will
accept; outside it you get `Invalid servo position`. Everything else is
the `PWM` statement, including the rule that omitting the second
position leaves that channel alone — which is what lets two servos share
a slice.

Scope-verified on GP0 at all five positions.

## `WS2812` — LED strips {#ws2812}

```basic
DIM INTEGER c(11)
FOR i = 0 TO 11 : c(i) = RGB(255, 0, 0) : NEXT i
WS2812 B, 7, 12, c()             ' twelve red LEDs on GP7
WS2812 B, 7, 1, RGB(0, 255, 0)   ' one LED may take a scalar colour
```

`WS2812 type, pin, nbr, colours%()` — MMBasic's statement, letter for
letter.  *type* is an unquoted `O` (original WS2812), `B` (WS2812B),
`S` (SK6812) or `W` (SK6812 RGBW — four bytes per LED, white in bits
31–24 of the colour).  *nbr* is 1–256; each colour integer is the
usual `RGB()` layout.

What is different underneath — and it is a machine-wide difference —
is HOW the wire is driven.  A PicoMite masks every interrupt for the
whole frame, which the machine's owner may do to their own firmware;
one process may not do it to every other process here.  Instead the
kernel keeps small PIO programs resident beside the I2S sound program,
and the statement packs the colour words into a kernel buffer, points
a DMA channel at it, and lets the HARDWARE clock the waveform out.
Audio keeps playing, counting inputs stay exact, the console keeps
echoing — the calling program alone waits for its frame.  The bit
timings were measured on the wire to the microsecond against the
reference's own numbers.

**Pins: GP0–GP7 and GP26 only** — the PIO block that drives this
shares the machine's audio pins' window and cannot reach GP34–46.
And the electrical rule that costs everyone an evening once: a strip
POWERED at 5 V wants ~3.5 V on its data line, which a 3.3 V GPIO does
not reach — power the strip at 3.3 V, or level-shift the data.

After the frame the pin is an ordinary driven-low digital output,
exactly as on a PicoMite.  The reset gap between frames is enforced
automatically from one statement to the next.

## `BITSTREAM` — arbitrary timed transitions {#bitstream}

```basic
DIM INTEGER d(99)
FOR i = 0 TO 99 : d(i) = 250 : NEXT i
BITSTREAM 2, 100, d()            ' 100 transitions, 250us apart
BITSTREAM 2, 100, d(), 1         ' open-collector form
```

`BITSTREAM pin, n, array() [, mode]` — *n* (1–10000) timed
transitions; each element is the microseconds to hold after it
(0–67108, integer or float array).  Mode 0 toggles the driven level,
starting from the pin's current output latch; mode 1 is MMBasic's
open-collector form — the pin starts released under a pull-up, each
transition toggles drive-low against released, and an odd *n* is
refused with the reference's own words.  Same engine, same pin rule
(GP0–GP7, GP26), same property: the machine keeps running — a
PicoMite masks interrupts for the SUM of the durations, which for a
long stream is seconds of dead machine, and here it is none.  The
timing grid is 50 ns, finer than the reference's own.  Element
truth was proven with the counting inputs: a 2000-transition stream
counts exactly 2000 edges on a looped-back pin.

## `SETTICK` — periodic timers

```basic
SUB Every100
  INC count
END SUB

SETTICK 100, Every100          ' every 100 ms
SETTICK 100, Every100, 2       ' timer 2 of 4
SETTICK PAUSE, 2               ' freeze it where it stands
SETTICK RESUME, 2
SETTICK 0, 0, 2                ' off
```

Four timers, numbered 1 to 4, period in milliseconds — MMBasic's
`NBRSETTICKS`. The number is optional and defaults to 1. The handler is
a parameterless SUB, as for pin interrupts, and everything said above
about them applies here too: it runs between statements, it does not
nest, and one interrupt is dispatched per statement boundary. A pin edge
and a tick falling due at the same moment dispatch the pin first, which
is MMBasic's scan order.

**Missed ticks are dropped, not queued.** If a handler takes longer than
its own period, the timer catches up by whole periods and fires once —
so a slow handler cannot spiral into a backlog it never clears. The
phase is kept, so the cadence does not drift.

Measured on the board: twenty ticks of 100 ms took **1999.98 ms**, and a
10 ms timer running beside a 50 ms one fired exactly 100 times in the
second the slow one took to reach twenty.

## `ON KEY` — the console

```basic
SUB AnyKey
  k$ = INKEY$                  ' the key is still there for you
END SUB

SUB QuitKey                    ' fires on "q" only, and eats it
  finished = 1
END SUB

ON KEY AnyKey                  ' any key
ON KEY 113, QuitKey            ' just this one
ON KEY 113, 0                  ' that one off
ON KEY 0                       ' the any-key one off
```

Two forms, and **what happens to the key is the difference between
them** — this is MMBasic's design, not an accident of ours:

* `ON KEY handler` fires while a key is *waiting*, and the key stays
  waiting. Your handler reads it with `INKEY$`. If it doesn't, the
  handler fires again at the next statement, because the key is still
  there.
* `ON KEY code, handler` fires only on that character code, and
  **consumes** it. It never reaches `INKEY$`, so a key reserved for a
  hot-key handler cannot also turn up in the program's ordinary input.

The specific form is checked first, so with both armed the reserved key
goes to its own handler and everything else goes to the general one.

Two things to know before relying on it:

**The console is checked at most every 5 ms**, not after every
statement. Looking is a system call, and a poll site runs after every
statement; checking each time would cost far more than most statements
do. Five milliseconds is the kernel's own tick and far below what anyone
can type or perceive, but it is a divergence from MMBasic, which looks
every time.

**A program reading keys holds the terminal**, and that has visible
consequences worth knowing.

The console has a line editor in front of it — the thing that gives you
history and cursor keys at the shell prompt. It takes every keystroke
while the terminal is in cooked mode with echo, and hands over a
finished line only when you press Enter. A program that wants
*keystrokes* has to stand it down, so the first `INKEY$` or armed
`ON KEY` puts the terminal into raw mode and **keeps it there** for the
rest of the program.

While it is held:

* **keys are not echoed** — nothing appears on screen unless your
  program prints it. This is MMBasic's behaviour for `INKEY$` too.
* **there is no line editing** — no backspace, no history, no cursor
  keys. Each keystroke goes straight to the program.
* **`INPUT` still works normally.** It gives the terminal back for the
  duration of the question and takes it again afterwards, so a program
  can mix `INKEY$` with `INPUT` and the typed answer is edited and
  echoed as usual.
* the terminal is **restored when the program ends**, however it ends.

This is what BBC BASIC and the editors on this machine already do.

## `KEYDOWN` — which keys are *held* {#keydown}

`INKEY$` tells you what was **typed**. `KEYDOWN` tells you what is
**down right now**, and for a game that is a different question: a
character stream has no way to say "up and fire together".

```basic
DO
  IF KEYDOWN(0) THEN                     ' anything at all held?
    FOR i = 1 TO KEYDOWN(0)
      k = KEYDOWN(i)                     ' 1 is the most recent
      IF k = 128 THEN y = y - 1          ' up
      IF k = 129 THEN y = y + 1          ' down
      IF k = 130 THEN x = x - 1          ' left

| argument | answer |
|---|---|
| `KEYDOWN(0)` | how many keys are held, 0 to 6 |
| `KEYDOWN(1)` … `KEYDOWN(6)` | the code of the *n*th, 1 being the most recent |
| `KEYDOWN(7)` | modifier bitmap: 1 left Alt, 2 left Ctrl, 4 left GUI, 8 left Shift, and 16/32/64/128 for the right-hand four |
| `KEYDOWN(8)` | locks: 1 caps, 2 num, 4 scroll |

**Six is the hardware's limit, not ours.** A USB keyboard's boot report
carries six concurrent key codes, which is exactly the six MMBasic
exposes, so this is the report itself rather than anything
reconstructed. Most keyboards also refuse certain three-key
combinations for reasons of their own wiring; that is the keyboard, and
no software can see past it.

**`KEYDOWN` empties the type-ahead buffer**, exactly as MMBasic does.
That is not tidiness: a held key still sends characters, and a game that
read only `KEYDOWN` would otherwise pile up minutes of them behind the
terminal, to be delivered to the shell the moment it exited. The
consequence is that `KEYDOWN` and `INKEY$` are **alternatives, not
layers** — whichever asks first gets the keystroke. Pick one per
program.

Like `INKEY$`, the first `KEYDOWN` puts the terminal in raw mode and
holds it, with everything the section above says about that.

## Asking the machine about itself: `MM.INFO` {#mm-info}

```basic
PRINT MM.DEVICE$                  ' Fuzix
PRINT MM.INFO(PLATFORM)           ' PC3   (or PC2)
PRINT MM.INFO(VERSION)            ' same number as MM.VER
```

**`MM.DEVICE$` is `"Fuzix"` — the firmware, and nothing else.** MMBasic
answers with its build (`PicoMiteVGA`, `PicoMiteHDMIUSB`), and a
program's whole use of it is to pick a path: `IF INSTR(MM.DEVICE$,
"PicoMite")`, `IF INSTR(MM.DEVICE$, "VGA")`. Every one of those
questions has the answer "no" here, and one word says so cleanly enough
to test with a plain comparison. **Which machine** it is has moved to
`MM.INFO(PLATFORM)`, which is where MMBasic keeps it too — `DEVICE` is
the firmware, `PLATFORM` is the board.

`MM.INFO(...)` and `MM.INFO$(...)` are the same function, as in MMBasic:
the sub-keyword decides the type, not the `$`.

| sub-keyword | answer |
|---|---|
| `DEVICE` | `"Fuzix"` |
| `PLATFORM` | `"PC3"` or `"PC2"` |
| `VERSION` | the release, as `MM.VER` |
| `PATH` | the directory the running program was started from, ending in `/` |
| `CURRENT` | the program's own file name |
| `DRIVE` | always `"A:"` — see below |
| `EXISTS FILE f$` | 1 a file, **-1 a directory**, 0 nothing there |
| `EXISTS DIR d$` | 1 if it is a directory |
| `FILESIZE f$` | bytes; -1 nothing there, -2 a directory |
| `OPTION BASE` | 0 or 1 |
| `PINNO "GP8"` | the pin a name stands for |
| `FONTHEIGHT`, `FONTWIDTH` | the current font's cell **times the current scale** |
| `HPOS`, `VPOS` | the graphics text cursor |
| `ERRNO`, `ERRMSG` | as `MM.ERRNO` and `MM.ERRMSG$` |
| `FLAGS` | all sixty-four scratch bits |
| `FONT ADDRESS n`, `FLASH ADDRESS n` | as before |

`MM.FONTHEIGHT`, `MM.FONTWIDTH`, `MM.HPOS` and `MM.VPOS` are the flat
spellings of four of those, and MMBasic has both — a program may write
either.

**`DRIVE` is always `"A:"`, and that is not a pretence.** This machine
has one filesystem and no drive letters. Programs that ask save the
drive, do a file operation and put it back; a constant answer makes that
round trip *correct* rather than merely harmless.

**The `-1` from `EXISTS FILE` is MMBasic's own**, and it earns its keep:
it is how a program tells "that name is a directory" from "there is
nothing there" without a second call.

`FONTHEIGHT` and `FONTWIDTH` follow `FONT`, and include the scale — so
`INC y, MM.INFO(FONTHEIGHT) + 1` moves down one line whatever font is
selected, which is what the shape is for.

Everything else MMBasic's `MM.INFO` reports is about hardware, a flash
program store or a network that is not here — and asking for one of
them is an error at translate time, not a zero. That is worth saying
plainly because it used to be a zero: a read like `MM.WIDTH` fell
through into the implied-variable rule and became a variable of that
name, so the program compiled, ran, and printed 0. Nothing in the `MM.`
namespace can become a variable now.

## `OPTION` {#option}

Seven `OPTION` statements are translated, and they mean what they mean
in MMBasic: `BASE`, `DEFAULT`, `EXPLICIT`, `ANGLE`, `CONSOLE`, `ESCAPE`,
and `UDP`/`TCP SERVER PORT`.

**`OPTION ANGLE DEGREES` makes `SIN`, `COS` and `TAN` take degrees and
`ATN`, `ATAN2`, `ASIN` and `ACOS` return them**, exactly as the
interpreter does it — the argument divided by 57.2957795130823229 going
in, the answer multiplied by it coming out. `DEG(` and `RAD(` are not
affected; they are the explicit converters and say what they convert.
`OPTION ANGLE RADIANS` is the default and the two spellings are the only
ones accepted.

Because a program here is compiled rather than interpreted, the setting
is folded in at translate time: it applies to the whole program,
including routines written above the `OPTION` line, and a program in
radians pays nothing whatever for the feature. The cost of folding is
that it cannot follow a program that changes its mind mid-run, so
`OPTION ANGLE` inside a `SUB` or `FUNCTION`, or set twice to different
values, is refused rather than applied to the wrong half of the program.

**Everything else in the `OPTION` namespace divides in two.** The
options that configure a PicoMite — a display panel, a keyboard layout,
the editor, the flash-saved defaults, `OPTION AUTORUN`, `OPTION
CPUSPEED` and the like — are **ignored with a warning**, because a
translated program computes and prints exactly the same with or without
them. Any other `OPTION`, including `OPTION COUNT` and `OPTION TAB`, is
**refused by name, and fatally**: an `OPTION` changes how the rest of
the program behaves, so quietly dropping the line would leave a program
that translates and then answers differently.

## Pin names: `GP8` {#gp-names}

Wherever a pin is expected you may write its **name** instead of its
number:

```basic
SETPIN GP4, DIN, PULLUP
IF PIN(GP4) = 0 THEN PRINT "pressed"
x = PORT(GP0, 8)                  ' GP0..GP7 as one number
n = MM.INFO(PINNO "GP" + STR$(i)) ' ... or build the name at run time
```

On this machine a pin **is** its GPIO number, so `GP8` is simply 8 —
MMBasic needs a lookup table here because its pin numbers are connector
pins. A variable you have declared with that name still wins.

This closes a trap rather than only adding convenience. Before it, `GP8`
in a program without `OPTION EXPLICIT` became an implied variable worth
zero, so `PIN(GP8)` quietly read **GP0** — a wrong pin, with nothing
said. A silent divergence outranks a missing feature, and this one is
now neither.

## Timers and the deliberate divergence

The 100 ms figure above is the one **deliberate divergence** from MMBasic, and
it is in your favour. MMBasic counts milliseconds in an interrupt and
fires when the count is *greater than* the period, so a `SETTICK 100`
there actually runs at 101 ms and a 16 ms game timer at 17 ms — about
6% slow. This keeps a microsecond deadline instead of a millisecond
counter and fires at the period you asked for. Nothing else about the
behaviour differs; if you are porting a program whose timing was tuned
against a PicoMite, it will run very slightly faster here.

**`PAUSE` gives the CPU up rather than spinning**, so a waiting program
does not hold the machine against everything else on it. The fraction
it cannot sleep through is bounded at 99 ms however long the pause.
**And `PAUSE` services interrupts while it waits**, as MMBasic's does:
that matters more than it sounds, because a program that arms a
`SETTICK` usually has a main loop of little but `PAUSE`, and a handler
in such a loop would otherwise never run at all.

Every read and write is a call into the kernel — comparable to drawing
one pixel, which is over a microsecond. That is ample for a switch or
an LED and nowhere near enough to bit-bang a protocol; write that in C,
or use the hardware that already exists for it.

## Practical notes

* One `.bas` file per program, because `cc` compiles one file per
  program. `Sub`s and `Function`s all live in that file.
* The C file is a normal file — you can keep it, edit it, or hand it
  to `cc` on another day.
* `mmbc` and `cc` each need a little room. On a machine with other
  things running, a large program is happier if you are not also
  holding a big file open in an editor.
* Programs built this way are the same objects `cc` produces from hand
  written C, so `bcdump` disassembles them and `BCRUN_BYTECODE=1`
  forces interpretation for comparison.

## A worked example: a barometric station {#qnh-example}

Everything in this chapter, on one screen. The program is `qnh.bas` in
`/root/MMBasic`; what follows is how it is built rather than a listing of
it.

It reads a BMP180 barometer, a potentiometer and the clock, and puts
the results on an ILI9341 panel that the firmware has never heard of —
including the text, drawn from the built-in fonts:

```
GP2  SCLK    GP3  MOSI    GP4  MISO     the panel
GP5  DC      GP6  RESET   GP7  CS       its control lines
GP0  LED                                backlight, PWM slice 0
GP38 SDA     GP39 SCL                   I2C2, the BMP180 at &H77
GP41                                    the potentiometer wiper
```

Build and run it the usual way:

```
# mmbc qnh.bas
# cc qnh.c
# ./qnh.bc
```

### What it is for

A barometer reads the pressure where it is standing. Weather reports
quote pressure **reduced to sea level**, because otherwise a reading
would say more about your altitude than about the weather — the
difference is about 12 hPa per hundred metres, which is the gap between
a settled day and a gale.

The reduction needs to know how high you are, and that is what the
potentiometer sets. The formula is the one in the BMP180's own
datasheet, inverted:

```basic
qnh = pHPa / (1 - alt / 44330.0) ^ 5.255
```

The result is QNH: what an altimeter should be set to so it reads
height above sea level.

### Reading the sensor

The BMP180 arithmetic is Bosch's, out of the datasheet, and the program
uses MMBasic's own BMP180 listing unchanged apart from the bus — the
part is on the I/O header rather than the QWIIC socket, so `SETPIN`
names the pins and `I2C2` opens the second controller:

```basic
SETPIN 38, 39, I2C2
I2C2 OPEN 400, 1000
I2C2 WRITE &H77, 1, 1, &HAA        ' the calibration block
I2C2 READ  &H77, 0, 22, i2cin$
ac1 = STR2BIN(int16, MID$(i2cin$, 1, 2), big)
```

Twenty-two bytes of calibration come back as a string and `STR2BIN`
picks signed and unsigned, big-endian words out of it.

### Reading the potentiometer

One line of setup, because `AIN` is MMBasic's:

```basic
SETPIN 41, AIN
alt = INT(PIN(41) / 3.3 * 1000 + 0.5)
```

`PIN` on an `AIN` pin gives volts: ten readings, sorted, the top two
and bottom two discarded and the remaining six averaged, scaled 3.3 V
over 4095 — MMBasic's filter, constant for constant. On the RP2350B
channel *n* is GP40 + *n*, so GP41 is channel 1.

One ADC count is about a quarter of a metre over a 1000 m range, so the
program ignores movements below two metres. A display that flickers
between 141 and 142 is worse than one that is a metre out.

### Drawing text on a panel the firmware does not know

This is the part that needs
[`MM.INFO(FONT ADDRESS)`](#font-address).
The fonts are cached once — address, cell and range, every value read
out of the font's own header:

```basic
FOR f = 1 TO 9
  a = MM.INFO(FONT ADDRESS f)
  fadr(f) = a
  IF a <> 0 THEN
    fwid(f) = PEEK(BYTE a)
    fhgt(f) = PEEK(BYTE a + 1)
    ffst(f) = PEEK(BYTE a + 2)
    fcnt(f) = PEEK(BYTE a + 3)
  ENDIF
NEXT f
```

Drawing one character is then: find its glyph, set the panel's window
to exactly one cell, and write the rows. The window is set once and the
panel advances by itself, so a glyph costs one address round trip and
one write per row rather than one per pixel:

```basic
g = fadr(f) + 4 + (c - ffst(f)) * w * h \ 8
setwin(x, y, x + w - 1, y + h - 1)
FOR row = 0 TO h - 1
  px$ = ""
  FOR col = 0 TO w - 1
    bidx = row * w + col
    bval = PEEK(BYTE g + bidx \ 8)
    IF (bval >> (7 - (bidx AND 7))) AND 1 THEN
      px$ = px$ + ink$
    ELSE
      px$ = px$ + paper$
    ENDIF
  NEXT col
  SPI WRITE w * 2, px$
NEXT row
```

`ink$` and `paper$` are two-byte RGB565 pixels built once per call, so
the inner loop appends rather than converting.

A row is `width × 2` bytes, which is why this works within the
255-byte string limit: 32 bytes for the 16×24 font, 48 for the 24×32.
A whole glyph would not fit — the 16×24 one is 768 bytes — but a row
always does.

### Two traps this example exists to show

**The panel does not refuse a window wider than itself.** It clamps the
window and still accepts every pixel you write into it, so the surplus
wraps onto the next row and the character comes out as noise. Fifteen
characters of the 16-pixel font is 240 pixels — the whole panel — so a
title starting at x=8 loses its last letter into the row below. The
program therefore drops a glyph that would overhang rather than drawing
it:

```basic
gx = x + (i - 1) * w
IF gx + w > SW THEN EXIT FOR
```

Silently short is a layout mistake you can see. Silently wrapped looks
like a bug in the font reader, and will cost you an evening.

**Mid grey is not visible.** `RGB565 &H8410` is a perfectly reasonable
grey and reads as almost nothing on this panel at 70 % backlight.
`&HBDF7` — about three quarters — is legible. Colours that look fine
in a table do not always survive a real display, and there is no
substitute for looking at it.

### What the translation looks like

`MM.INFO(FONT ADDRESS f)` becomes a runtime call and `PEEK` becomes a
load, which is the whole point of the exercise — the address is not
marshalled anywhere, it is used:

```c
v_a = mm_fontaddr(v_f);
H->v_fadr[(int)(v_f)] = v_a;
if (((v_a) != (0LL))) {
    H->v_fwid[(int)(v_f)] = mmpk_byte(v_a);
    H->v_fhgt[(int)(v_f)] = mmpk_byte(((v_a) + (1LL)));
    H->v_ffst[(int)(v_f)] = mmpk_byte(((v_a) + (2LL)));
    H->v_fcnt[(int)(v_f)] = mmpk_byte(((v_a) + (3LL)));
}
```

(`H->` is where arrays and strings live — one allocation the program
owns, rather than globals.)

and `mmpk_byte` is one line in `mmb_peek.h`:

```c
MMG_FN MMINTEGER mmpk_byte(MMINTEGER addr)
{
	return (MMINTEGER)*MMPK_PTR(unsigned char, addr);
}
```

Reading font data compiles to a `ldrb`. There is no MMU to go through,
no copy, and no system call — the flash the kernel keeps its fonts in
is simply memory that this program can read.

The whole program is 15 KB of BASIC and compiles to about 63 KB of
bytecode.

## Networking from BASIC: the WEB family {#web-family}

The [Networking](#networking) chapter gets the machine onto a
network; this section is what a BASIC program can do once it is
there. The `WEB` family is the WebMite's — MMBasic on a Pico W —
and a WebMite program's networking moves across as it is written,
with the differences collected in
[Migrating a WebMite program](#webmite-migration).

One difference sits in front of everything else: on a WebMite the
network credentials and the server port are *saved options*, set once
at the prompt. Here the machine joins from `/etc/wifi.conf` at boot,
and a program that serves says so itself, with a statement:

    WEB TCP SERVER PORT 80

The `OPTION TCP SERVER PORT 80` and `OPTION UDP SERVER PORT n`
spellings are accepted as aliases, so a WebMite listing runs
unedited.

`WEB CONNECT` with no arguments checks the link and raises
`WIFI not connected` if the radio has no address — the same gate the
WebMite applies. With arguments — `WEB CONNECT ssid$, pass$` — it
joins that network for this run, without saving anything;
`/etc/wifi.conf` remains the owner of the boot-time answer.

### UDP

    WEB UDP SERVER PORT 7777          ' bind the receive socket
    WEB UDP INTERRUPT GotOne          ' a sub to run per datagram
    WEB UDP SEND "192.168.1.79", 7777, "hello"

Inside the interrupt sub the WebMite's variables are live:
`MM.MESSAGE$` is the datagram and `MM.ADDRESS$` the sender.
Interrupts fire between statements, exactly as the WebMite's do; a
program that never reaches a statement boundary (one long `PAUSE` is
fine, a tight pure loop is not) never sees one. The first datagram
to a peer the machine has not talked to before can be lost to the
ARP exchange — the WebMite's stack sheds it the same way — so
protocols start with a greeting, or simply send twice.

### The TCP client

    Dim Integer b(512)                ' a LONGSTRING holds the reply
    WEB OPEN TCP CLIENT "api.openweathermap.org", 80
    WEB TCP CLIENT REQUEST "GET /data/2.5/weather?..." + Chr$(10) + Chr$(13), b()
    WEB CLOSE TCP CLIENT
    Print LGetStr$(b(), 1, 200)

`REQUEST` writes, then collects the reply into the LONGSTRING until
it has been quiet for half a second; `READ` collects without writing;
`WRITE` writes without collecting. One behaviour is worth knowing
because two firmwares share it for different reasons: **`REQUEST`
discards anything that arrived before it writes.** That is what lets
an SMTP conversation ignore the server's banner — the greeting lands
after `OPEN`, and the first `REQUEST` throws it away before sending
`EHLO`, so every command gets *its own* answer.

Timeouts are optional trailing arguments (`OPEN`'s default is 5
seconds). A refused connection, a reset, and a timeout all raise
errors a program traps the WebMite way, `ON ERROR SKIP` before the
statement and `MM.ERRNO` after.

One deliberate WebMite fidelity: no interrupts fire while a client
statement is waiting, and a program cannot fetch from **its own**
server — the interrupt that would answer cannot run until the fetch
finishes. Both firmwares deadlock that shape (the client times out);
test a server from another machine.

### TLS

    WEB TLS CA "/etc/ca.pem"          ' check certificates from now on
    WEB OPEN TLS CLIENT "www.google.com", 443, 20000

`TLS CLIENT` is `TCP CLIENT` with the handshake underneath;
`REQUEST`, `READ`, `WRITE` and `CLOSE` are then the same statements.
Until `WEB TLS CA` has loaded a bundle the session is encrypted but
**not authenticated** — the WebMite starts in the same state — and
after it, a bad certificate refuses the connection: expired.badssl.com
stays closed while google answers. `WEB TLS NOVERIFY` turns checking
back off. The machine's bundle is `/etc/ca.pem`, the same file the
shell's `tlsca` uses.

### The server

    WEB TCP SERVER PORT 80
    WEB TCP INTERRUPT WebInterrupt

    Sub WebInterrupt
      Local Integer a%, b(512)
      For a% = 1 To MM.Info(MAX CONNECTIONS)
        LongString CLEAR b()
        WEB TCP READ a%, b()
        If LLen(b()) > 0 Then
          If LInStr(b(), "GET / HTTP") > 0 Then
            WEB TRANSMIT PAGE a%, "index.html"
          Else
            WEB TRANSMIT CODE a%, 404
          EndIf
        EndIf
      Next a%
    End Sub

Eight connections (`MM.INFO(MAX CONNECTIONS)` = 8, as the WebMite),
each polled by number from the interrupt: `WEB TCP READ` fills a
LONGSTRING with the request, `WEB TCP SEND conn, b()` answers with a
LONGSTRING, `WEB TRANSMIT CODE conn, n` sends a bare status,
`WEB TRANSMIT FILE conn, name$, mime$` sends a file, and
`WEB TCP CLOSE conn` hangs up. NUL bytes in a request arrive as
spaces, idle connections are reaped, and the interrupt fires between
statements of whatever the main program is doing.

### Serving a page with live values: `WEB TRANSMIT PAGE`

    WEB TRANSMIT PAGE a%, "index.html"

The page is HTML with expressions in braces:

    <p>Temperature {Str$(t, 1, 1)} at {Time$}</p>

Each `{expression}` is evaluated when the page is served and its
value replaces the brace. This is the WebMite's page mechanism, and
a compiled program keeps it by compiling every expression the page
uses **at the statement that names the page** — with whatever
variables, parameters and functions are in scope right there, which
is why a page can say `{Title(pnbr)}` inside a sub whose parameter
is `pnbr`. At run time the engine matches each brace against that
compiled set *by text*, so the page on the card can be edited freely
— reworded, reordered, restyled — as long as every expression it
uses still appears somewhere in the compiled set; a brace the
program has never seen raises an error naming it. `{{` puts a
literal brace in the page. The page file lives beside the program
and is read at *translate* time too, so translate in its directory.

### `JSON$`

    v$ = Json$(b(), "sys.sunrise")
    v$ = Json$(b(), "list[0].main.temp")

The WebMite's own dotted-path walker, to the letter: intermediate
names are case-sensitive and the final one is not, `[n]` selects the
n-th child, numbers come back formatted as MMBasic formats them,
`null` and a missing name are `""`, and asking for an object rather
than a value is the one error. Structural validation happens first,
so `Invalid JSON data` means the document, not the path.

### The clock, a ping, and email

    WEB NTP                     ' set the clock from pool.ntp.org, UTC
    WEB NTP 9.5                 ' ... to UTC+9:30
    WEB NTP 2, "time.example"   ' offset and server
    WEB PING "192.168.1.79", 4  ' ping(8), output on the console

`WEB NTP` runs `ntpdate` underneath and takes the WebMite's
arguments: a float offset in hours (-12 to 14, half-hour zones
included) applied to the clock, because MMBasic's clock is local
time. An unanswered `WEB PING` is not an error — `ping` reports
`recv 0` and carries on; only a name that will not resolve raises.

Email is SMTP written with the client statements, and the recipe
that works in 2026 is Gmail with an App Password: turn on 2-Step
Verification, create the password at myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
(16 characters, shown once — remove the spaces), then:

    Const cr = Chr$(13) + Chr$(10)
    Dim Integer b(512)
    WEB TLS CA "/etc/ca.pem"
    WEB OPEN TLS CLIENT "smtp.gmail.com", 465, 20000
    Pause 300
    WEB TCP CLIENT REQUEST "EHLO pc3" + cr, b()
    WEB TCP CLIENT REQUEST "AUTH LOGIN" + cr, b()
    WEB TCP CLIENT REQUEST b64$(addr$) + cr, b()
    WEB TCP CLIENT REQUEST b64$(apppass$) + cr, b()
    WEB TCP CLIENT REQUEST "MAIL FROM:<" + addr$ + ">" + cr, b()
    WEB TCP CLIENT REQUEST "RCPT TO:<" + to$ + ">" + cr, b()
    WEB TCP CLIENT REQUEST "DATA" + cr, b()
    WEB TCP CLIENT REQUEST "From: ..." + cr + "." + cr, b()
    If LInStr(b(), "250 2.0.0") > 0 Then Print "sent"
    WEB CLOSE TCP CLIENT

Port 465 is implicit TLS, which both firmwares have; port 587 is
STARTTLS, which neither does. The greeting is discarded by the first
`REQUEST` (the rule above), `MATH(BASE64 ENCODE in$, out$)` does the
encoding (`b64$` above wraps it), and Gmail's acceptance line is
`250 2.0.0 OK`. `/root/MMBasic/retic` sends its alerts exactly this
way. Keep the App Password in a file (`/etc/` is the convention),
never in a program listing.

### What is not there

`WEB MQTT`, the `STREAM` client forms, and `WEB SCAN` are not
translated yet; each is refused by name at translate time, never
silently accepted. The WebMite's hardware edge counters — `SETPIN
FIN/CIN/PIN`, the flow-meter path — **work** (see the `SETPIN`
section: fixed on GP4–GP7); only `OPTION COUNT` itself, which moves
the pins, stays refused.

## Migrating a WebMite program {#webmite-migration}

A compiler is not an interpreter, and this machine is not a Pico W —
so a WebMite program usually needs a handful of small, honest edits.
This section is the complete list of kinds. The worked example is on
the card: `/root/MMBasic/retic` is a real, shipped WebMite product
(Geoff Graham's reticulation controller, 49 KB of BASIC and three
web pages), and every line its port touched is marked `'PC3:` with
the reason, catalogued in its `MIGRATION.md`.

**Saved options become machine configuration.** The WebMite stores
options in flash; here the same facts live where a Unix system keeps
them:

| WebMite | Pico Computer 3 |
|---|---|
| `OPTION WIFI "ssid", "key"` | `/etc/wifi.conf`, joined at boot |
| `OPTION TCP SERVER PORT 80` (saved) | the statement, at the top of the program |
| `OPTION TELNET CONSOLE ON` | not carried; the serial console is the console |
| `OPTION AUTORUN ON` | accepted and ignored; autorun is a line in `/etc/rc` |

**Paths mostly work as written.** `A:/settings.dat`, `A:\file` and
`A:file` all reach the plain name, resolved against the directory
the program runs from — `MM.INFO(DRIVE)` answers a constant `"A:"`
for the programs that save and restore it. The one edit: a **bare
leading slash** is a real absolute path on this machine
(`/etc/ca.pem` is load-bearing), where the WebMite read it as the
drive root — so a page named `"/index.html"` becomes `"index.html"`.

**Pins move to this machine's header.** The I/O header brings out
GP0–GP7, GP26 and GP34–GP46; everything else belongs to the board.
A WebMite program's pin constants are usually gathered at the top —
retic's all were — so this is a table edit, not a hunt.

**Two statements keep their purpose and change their mechanism.**
`WATCHDOG` is accepted and does nothing, with a translate-time
warning: the hardware watchdog belongs to the kernel, and wedge
recovery on a Unix machine is a restart loop in `/etc/rc`.
`CPU RESTART` re-executes the program instead of rebooting the
processor — run the program from its own directory so the relative
re-exec finds it.

**Email means Gmail now.** retic shipped with SendGrid and SMTP2GO;
the first is unusable and the second's free tier is gone. The Gmail
sequence in the previous section replaces both — in retic it is a
drop-in for the two provider branches, the setup page's username and
password fields become the Gmail address and App Password, and the
success test becomes `250 2.0.0`.

**The compiler is stricter than the interpreter, and it will tell
you.** MMBasic's expression evaluator silently ignores trailing text
after a complete expression, and its pre-scan tolerates a `Sub` with
no `End Sub`. retic V1.3 — a shipped product — carries four stray
`)` and one missing `End Sub` that MMBasic never noticed. The
translator refuses each with a line number; every fix is one
character. Anything genuinely untranslated is likewise refused **by
name** at translate time — the port starts with `mmbc prog.bas` and
reading what it says.

**Flow meters: move them to GP4–GP7.** `SETPIN n, CIN` counts edges
in hardware and `Pin()` reads and zeroes the count, exactly as on the
WebMite — but the four count pins are **fixed at GP4–GP7** here, so
delete the `OPTION COUNT` line (it is refused by name) and change the
pin number. retic's sampling block predates the facility and is still
commented out; re-enabling it is the one-line pin change plus
uncommenting.

To see all of this working, from the card:

    # cd /root/MMBasic/retic
    # mmbc retic.bas -o retic.c
    # cc -o retic retic.c
    # ./retic

then point a browser at the machine's address.

## Making a big program fit — and run fast {#making-it-fit}

A compiled program pays for its size twice. First there is the obvious
budget: a process gets about 330 KB, `bcrun` and its working space take
about 145 KB of that (170 KB before v0.19 slimmed it), and what
remains holds your code (which expands about 1.8× when it is
translated to native ARM), your variables and your stack. Since v0.19
your code also includes copies of the runtime families the program
actually uses — `SORT`, `LONGSTRING`, `DATA` and the rest — a few
hundred bytes each, in exchange for the 24 KB every program no longer
carries for all of them at once. Second, and less obvious: any single `Sub`, `Function` or
main line whose bytecode exceeds the translator's buffers stays
**interpreted**, which runs about 2.7× slower — and the main line, the
part between the top of the file and the first `Sub`, is compiled as
one function. A game whose whole loop lives in the main line can grow
that one function past the cap and end up with its hottest code being
its slowest.

**Recursion goes 255 levels deep.** The limit is not the stack: a
by-reference argument occupies a slot that cannot be released until the
call returns, and there are 256 of them. Past that a program stops with
`Expression too complex` rather than misbehaving. For scale, a
recursive walk over a million-node balanced tree is twenty levels deep.
The guard does not cover routines the translator has turned into native
code, so a routine that recurses with no terminating condition is still
a program that crashes the machine.

The rules below come from porting PicoMan (Geoff Graham's PacMan,
1,250 lines, graphics-heavy). As it arrived it compiled to 101 KB of
bytecode with a 63 KB main line — too big to translate, too big to
load fully native. With the compiler taught the rule below it is
38 KB, every function translates, and the whole game images at 134 KB
— unmodified. Numbers below are from that exercise. Compute-heavy
programs rarely hit any of this — the solar eclipse benchmark has
never been near a limit — because number crunching lives naturally in
functions over a few variables. Games are different: they draw, and
they grow main lines.

**1. `ON ERROR IGNORE` is the most expensive statement in the
language.** For an error to be *survivable*, the compiler must emit
checked arithmetic — every array index, every division — so the error
is reported rather than corrupting memory. `ON ERROR IGNORE` arms that
for an unbounded stretch of the program, so its presence anywhere
makes the **whole program** pay: about 2.6× on code size (it was 62 of
PicoMan's 101 KB while the compiler still treated every `ON ERROR`
this way). `ON ERROR SKIP [nn]`, by contrast, covers only the next
`nn` statements, and the compiler emits the checked forms for exactly
that window — PicoMan's one `On Error Skip` over a first-time `Blit
Close` costs a few dozen bytes, not sixty thousand. So: prefer `SKIP`
with a literal count, tightly around the fallible statement, and keep
`IGNORE` for short probe programs. Two prints of `MM.ERRNO` cost less
than one `IGNORE`. One care with `SKIP` in a compiled program: the
interpreter's count follows execution into a called SUB, statement by
statement, while the compiled window covers the statements *written*
after the `ON ERROR SKIP` (plus one for each routine entered) — a
skip that relies on being consumed deep inside a callee's arithmetic
behaves like the interpreter only under `IGNORE`. Runtime command
errors — a `Blit Close` on nothing, a missing file, an I2C device
that does not answer — are trapped anywhere the count is armed, in
either world.

**2. Keep the main line thin.** The main line is one function, and a
function only runs at full speed if it translates. Put the work in
`Sub`s and `Function`s and keep the main line to setup and a loop that
calls them. A web of `GOTO`s pins code into the main line; `GOTO` is
fine within a routine, but reaching a block only by `GOTO` keeps it —
and everything it drags in — in the one function that must stay small.

**3. Locals are cheaper than globals.** Every reference to a global
variable costs a 5-byte address in bytecode and 8-10 bytes translated;
a `Local` or a parameter costs 2-3 and often 2-4. Before its rework,
36% of PicoMan's main line was global addressing. In a `Sub`, declare
scratch variables `Local`; pass coordinates as parameters rather than
parking them in globals.

**4. Fold repetition into a `Sub`.** Drawing statements are the widest
statements in the language — every argument is a 64-bit expression
that must be built and pushed, so one seven-argument `Circle` costs
120-140 bytes *each time it appears*. Four near-identical `Triangle`
statements for four directions are one `Sub` with parameters. This is
ordinary factoring, but on this machine it is also how the code stays
under the translation caps.

**5. `DATA` is nearly free; code is dear.** `DATA` values go to the
data segment byte-for-byte (unused columns are pruned), and reading
them is cheap. A table beats a computed unroll: PicoMan's 42 KB
shortest-path database costs almost nothing in code, while the same
information as `If` chains would be enormous.

**Seeing where you stand.** `ls -l prog.bc` gives the object size.
`THUMB_VERBOSE=1 cc prog.c` prints one line per function — `native:
name (bytecode -> native bytes)` — and, for any function that stayed
bytecode, the reason: `size policy` means it was too big to translate,
and that function will run interpreted. A program that is still too
big to load can be built `BCODE_ONLY=1 cc prog.c`: about 2.7× slower,
but roughly a third the code.

## When a program will not start: `THUMB_BUDGET` {#thumb-budget}

The message to recognise is this one, and it is the kernel's, not the
compiler's:

```
# ./robots.bc
exec: pid 27 needs 76 blocks, 74 free beside a 10-block neighbour (pool 84)
./robots.bc: out of memory (847 symbols)
```

**It is not a report of free memory.** A program has to be able to sit
in the pool *beside the biggest other process*, so that the swapper can
always bring it back in; the number it is measured against is
`84 minus the biggest neighbour`, and the neighbour is usually the shell you
typed the command into. So a program can fail to start on a machine
with plenty free, and the same program starts on a machine whose shell
happens to be smaller.

`THUMB_BUDGET` is the lever. It caps the **total native bytes** the
compiler may add to the object; functions compiled before the cap is
reached run native, and everything after it stays bytecode and runs
interpreted. It is unset by default, which means uncapped — the
compiler takes all the native code it can get, which is what you want
right up until the program stops fitting.

```
# THUMB_BUDGET=140000 cc prog.bas
```

PETSCII Robots is the worked example, measured on the machine:

| build | `robots.bc` | blocks | |
|-------|-------------|--------|--|
| uncapped | 209,022 | 76 | refused |
| `THUMB_BUDGET=140000` | 196,782 | under 74 | runs |
| `BCODE_ONLY=1` | ~107,000 | far fewer | runs, 2.7× slower |

Robots needs more headroom than its own size: `Load image` and
`Play modsample` each start a helper *while the game is running*, and
that helper wants about eleven blocks. A program that spawns nothing
can use the pool right up to the line.

**How to choose a number.** Start high and come down. The budget is
spent **first-come, in the order the functions appear in the file** —
not in order of how hot they are — so the code that loses its native
translation is whatever happens to be at the end of your program. If
the program fits but has become slow, either raise the budget until it
only just fits, or move the routines that matter to the top of the
file. `THUMB_VERBOSE=1` shows which functions stayed bytecode.

Prefer a budget to `BCODE_ONLY`: the budget keeps most of the program
native and costs speed only at the tail, while `BCODE_ONLY` gives up
all of it.

**One trick for a program that is only just too big.** `exec` it from
the shell:

```
# exec ./prog.bc
```

`exec` replaces the shell rather than forking, so the shell stops being
a neighbour and its ten blocks join the room available. It is worth
knowing because it diagnoses as well as fixes: if a program starts this
way and not the ordinary way, the problem is the pair and not the
program. The cost is that when the program exits there is no shell to
return to and you are back at `login:`.

# `mmbedit`: MMBasic's editor

MMBasic's full-screen editor is ported and runs as an ordinary Fuzix
program, so BASIC is written, translated, compiled and run without
leaving the machine:

```
# mmbedit prog.bas
```

It is the editor from the firmware, with the same keys:

| Key | |
|-----|-----|
| `ESC` | leave the editor |
| `F1` | save |
| `F2` | save, exit, compile and run — see below |
| `F3` / `F6` | find / find again |
| `F4` | mark — then the cursor keys extend the selection |
| `F5` | paste |
| `F7` / `F8` | replace / replace again |
| `F9` / `F10` | read a file in / write the selection out |
| `F12` or `Ctrl-A` | beautify: re-indent and case the keywords |

**`F2` is "save and run", the way a compiled machine can be.** On a
PicoMite `F2` handed the program straight back to the interpreter; here
the editor saves, exits and runs `cc -r` on the file, which builds it —
a `.bas` through `mmbc` first — and runs it if it built:

```
# mmbedit prog.bas          F2
cc -r prog.bas
wrote prog.mb.c
..........................
hello from prog
#
```

A compile error stops there, with the errors on the screen; nothing
runs. That is the one place this parts company with the interpreter,
which put you back in the editor at the offending line — here you are
at the shell, and `mmbedit prog.bas` again is the way back.

It happens only for `.bas`, `.BAS`, `.c` and `.C`; edit anything else
and `F2` says there is nothing to compile. `Ctrl-W` is `F2`'s alias, as
in MMBasic.

One thing worth knowing before trusting the run: a line `mmbc` cannot
translate is **commented out and reported**, not treated as an error, so
the program builds without it and `F2` will run it. The report is on the
screen above the output — read it rather than the fact that something
ran.

In mark mode the legend changes: `DEL` deletes, `F4` cuts, `F5`
copies, `F10` exports the selection to a file. The status line shows
line, column and INS/OVR, and the function key legend shortens itself
to fit the terminal width.

**The colour coding answers "will this compile?"** A keyword `mmbc` can
translate is cyan; one only the interpreter knows is blue. That second
colour is the useful one here, because a program is compiled rather than
run as you type it, and it is worth seeing `MM.WATCHDOG` or `REDIM` in
blue before you build rather than after. The lists come from the
translator's own tables, so they cannot drift from what it does.

The editor works over the serial port as well as on the HDMI console —
it drives a VT100, and the console emits VT100 function key sequences.
Files with CRLF line endings are accepted; the CRs are stripped on
load, which matters because most files arrive from a PC.

**It takes the screen back if a program left it in a graphics mode.**
The editor draws on the text console, which is what `MODE 1` selects. A
program that finished in `MODE 2` leaves the screen 320×240 in sixteen
colours, and the console is then not what the monitor is showing — so
the editor would be painting where nothing can be seen. `mmbedit`
switches to `MODE 1` on the way in and puts the old mode back on the way
out, including when it is killed, so a program's screen survives a trip
through the editor and comes back as it was.

## The other editor: `vi`

`mmbedit` is for BASIC. For small text files — a shell script,
`/etc/motd`, a short C file — there is a `vi`:

```
# vi hello.c
```

It is Levee, David Parsons' small vi clone, with modal editing, the
`:` commands and the usual movement keys. It has been on the card
since the beginning under its own name, `levee`, which still works:
`vi` and `levee` are two names for one file.

**Its edit buffer is 64 KB**, which is enough for any source file you
are likely to write on the machine. Levee's own default is 4 KB — it
was written for 8-bit micros, where that was a fair share of the
machine — and this port raises it, since a process here may have most
of a 340 KB pool to itself.

Open something larger than the buffer and Levee says `[overflow]` on
the status line and holds the file **read-only**: you can look and
move around, but `:w` answers "File is readonly" rather than writing a
truncated file back. That is the safe way round, and worth knowing as
the signal that a file is too big rather than that something is wrong.

One difference from a full `vi` to watch: `cw` on the last word of a
line joins the following line onto it.

\newpage

# The FAT partition and the `fat` command

Partition 1 of the SD card is ordinary FAT, readable and writable by
any PC — this is how files travel to Fuzix, because nothing else can
mount the Unix partition. Format it once in Windows (FAT or FAT32,
**not exFAT**), then simply copy files onto it.

On the Fuzix side, the `fat` command reads and writes it (long
filenames and subdirectories included):

```
# fat info
/dev/hda1: FAT16, 32695 clusters of 2048 bytes (62 MB)
# fat ls
    4523  My Program.bas
   <dir>  BASIC
# fat ls basic
# fat get "my program.bas" /root/prog.bas
# fat get demo.bin                    (lowercased name in current dir)
# fat put results.txt                 into the root, under its own name
# fat put results.txt BASIC           into a directory
# fat put prog.bas "My Program.bas"   naming it as well
```

`fat put` is the complement of `fat get`, and the card is then the
route in *both* directions: write the file from Fuzix, switch the
machine off, put the card in a PC. An existing file of the same name
is replaced. Names are stored as the desktop stores them — a long
name with spaces and mixed case arrives intact, and a plain lower case
name like `results.txt` does not come back shouting.

Two things it will not do. It does not create directories, so make
them from the desktop (or `fat put x SOMEDIR` into one that exists).
And it will not take a name FAT cannot hold — one containing
`\ / : * ? " < > |`, or longer than 64 characters — rather than
quietly storing something else under a name you did not choose.

**Pulling the card out mid-write.** The order of writing is chosen so
that this is survivable: the file's data reaches the card before the
directory entry that names it, and when a file is replaced the old
copy is released only after the entry points at the new one. Lose
power at any moment and the directory still describes a file that is
entirely there — the old one or the new one, never half of each. What
can be left behind is space marked in use that no file claims, which
the desktop's own check-disk reclaims. It is still worth letting the
prompt come back before switching off.

`doswrite` (the venerable Minix FAT12/16 tool) is also here, and
predates `fat put`; it handles FAT16 only and knows nothing of long
names.

\newpage

# Moving files over the serial port

The FAT partition carries files in both directions now that `fat put`
exists, but it carries them at the speed of switching the machine off
and walking the card to a PC. The serial console moves a file while
the machine is still running, with nothing on the board but `uue` and
`uud` — and it is the only route that needs no card swapping at all.

The idea is older than the machine: `uuencode` turns any file into
printable text, and printable text survives a terminal. Both tools are
in `/bin`:

```
# uue FILE            writes FILE.uue - the encoded text
# uud FILE.uue        decodes it back, recreating the original name
```

## Sending a file to the board

On the PC, encode the file, then have the board read the text into a
file and decode it:

```
# cat > prog.uue          (now paste or send the encoded text)
^D
# uud prog.uue
# ls -l prog.bas
```

**The one thing that will bite you is flow control.** The terminal
input queue is 132 bytes. Sending encoded text as fast as the port
will take it overruns that queue and loses characters silently — a
62-character line sent every 25 ms still loses roughly 60% of the
text, and the damage only shows up as a corrupt file at the end. Two
ways to avoid it:

* **Let the terminal pace it.** Any sender with a per-line delay *and*
  a wait for the echo will do. The delay alone is not enough.
* **Use the supplied script.** `devtools/uusend.py` in the source tree
  does exactly this: it types the text one line at a time and waits
  for each line to echo before sending the next, so at most one line
  is ever in flight. It then runs `uud` for you.

```
python uusend.py local.bas prog.bas --port=COM11
```

Note that `uusend.py` takes a **bare** remote filename — it drives one
`ucp`-style session with `cd` and plain names, so `mv` the file
afterwards if it belongs somewhere else.

## Fetching a file from the board

The other direction is easier, because the board is the slow end:

```
# uue report.txt
# cat report.uue
```

Capture the session to a file in your terminal program, cut away
anything before `begin` and after `end`, and decode it on the PC.

## Programs to use

**Linux (and macOS, and WSL):**

* `uuencode` / `uudecode` come from the **sharutils** package
  (`apt install sharutils`). macOS has `uuencode` built in.
* For the terminal, **picocom** (simplest), **minicom** (its
  `Ctrl-A S` menu includes an `ascii-xfer` that paces lines), or
  **screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200**.
* If sharutils is awkward, Python needs no install:
  `python3 -c "import binascii,sys; ..."` — or just use
  `devtools/uusend.py`, which does the encoding itself.

**Windows:**

* **Tera Term** is the pick — free, and its *File → Send file* has a
  per-line delay setting under *Setup → Serial port* (set a transmit
  delay of a few ms per character or 30–50 ms per line). This is the
  easiest reliable route without scripting.
* **PuTTY** works for capture (*Session → Logging*) but has no
  paced file send; pasting a large file into it will lose characters.
* **RealTerm** can send a file with a configurable delay, and is good
  at capturing binary.
* For the encode/decode step, Windows has no built-in `uuencode`. Use
  **WSL** (then it is the Linux instructions), **Python** for
  Windows, or **UUDeview**, which still builds and runs.

Whatever you use, the check at the end is the same: `sum` the file on
both machines and compare. On the board, `sum FILE`.

# Networking {#networking}

The Pico Computer 3 has a CYW43 radio, and from v0.18 Fuzix can use it:
Wi-Fi, DHCP, TCP/IP, DNS and TLS. This chapter is how to get on a
network and what you can do once you are.

A Pico Computer 2 has no radio — those pins are its SD card and LED —
and the same kernel runs on both. It will tell you:

    # wifi
    no radio (Pico Computer 2)

## Joining a network

Put your network in `/etc/wifi.conf`. It ships with the format in its
own comments and you replace one line:

    MYNETWORK MYPASSWORD 2

Three fields: the SSID, the key, and the authentication type — `0`
open, `1` WPA-TKIP, `2` WPA2-AES, `3` WPA2 mixed. **`2` is what almost
every home network wants.** If the SSID or the password contains a
space you cannot use this file; use the command form below instead.

The file holds a password in plain text. It ships mode 600 and `wifi`
complains if it finds otherwise, but anyone who can read the card can
read the key.

Then:

    # wifi -f
    joining
    up, -61 dBm
    ip      192.168.1.245
    mask    255.255.255.0
    gateway 192.168.1.254
    dns     192.168.1.254

That is a DHCP lease. `wifi -f` also writes `/etc/resolv.conf` from it,
which is what makes names work.

Without the file:

    # wifi MYNETWORK MYPASSWORD          joins, without saving anything
    # wifi                               reports what the radio is doing
    # wifi -d                            disconnect

**Bringing the radio up stops the machine for about half a second.**
The kernel uploads 230 KB of firmware to the chip, and a Fuzix system
call is not interrupted, so nothing else runs during it — including the
keyboard. Joining the network afterwards does *not* block: that part
runs in the background while you carry on.

To have it join at boot, add `wifi -f` to `/etc/rc`.

## Setting the clock {#ntp-clock}

Do this before anything involving TLS:

    # ntpdate -s time.cloudflare.com
    # setdate -w

**`-s` is what sets the clock.** Without it `ntpdate` prints the time
and changes nothing, which is a query and not a mistake — but following
it with `setdate -w` then writes the *old* time to the DS3231. `-d`
prints the time as well as setting it.

`setdate -w` writes the clock to the battery-backed DS3231 so it
survives a power cut. **A certificate is only valid between two
dates**, so a machine that thinks it is 1970 will reject every
certificate on the internet and the error will not mention the clock.

NTP speaks UTC and nothing in the reply says where you are, so that
sets the machine to UTC. `-o` adds whole hours and `-O` adds seconds
on top, for the half-hour zones:

    # ntpdate -s -o 1 time.cloudflare.com       British summer time
    # ntpdate -s -o 5 -O 1800 time.cloudflare.com     India

**Every option must come before the server name.** `getopt` here is the
System V one and stops at the first argument that is not an option, so
`ntpdate host -o 5` used to print UTC and ignore the `-o` — an answer
that looks right and is five hours out. It is refused now. The same
rule applies to every command on this machine; GNU's `getopt` shuffles
the arguments, which is why the habit does not survive the trip from a
Linux box.

## Looking around

    # ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
    45 bytes from 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) req=0 time=9.6 ms
    ...
    sent 4, recv 4, 100%
    rtt min/avg/max = 9.6/39.2/95.0 ms

`ping` without `-c` runs until you press `Ctrl-C`, and prints the same
summary when you do.

    # dig example.com                    look up a name
    # htget http://example.com/ page.htm fetch a page over HTTP

`htget` takes a URL and a filename. It understands chunked replies, so
what lands in the file is the page and not the HTTP framing.

## TLS, and why the certificates matter

    # tlsget 104.20.23.154 example.com /

`tlsget` takes an **address and a name separately** — the address to
connect to, the name for the certificate and for SNI. Keeping the
resolver out of it makes it a test of the connection and nothing else.

Out of the box a TLS session is **encrypted but not authenticated**.
Nobody in the middle can read it, but anyone in the middle can pretend
to be the far end, because nothing is checking that the certificate
belongs to who it claims. To fix that, load the bundle of certificate
authorities that ships on the card:

    # tlsca /etc/ca.pem
    TLS: 11085 bytes loaded, certificates are CHECKED

From then on a connection whose certificate does not check out is
refused rather than made. To go back:

    # tlsca -n
    TLS: certificates are NOT checked

**Which authorities you need is not guessable.** The bundle carries
ten roots covering Let's Encrypt, Google, DigiCert, Amazon, SSL.com
and Sectigo, which between them cover most of the web — but sites move
between authorities, and a site signed by one that is not in the file
will be refused. Even the *same* authority can trip this: Cloudflare's
`1.1.1.1` chains to SSL.com's older ECC root, not their 2022 one, and
only a bundle carrying the right certificate — not merely the right
company — verifies it. To find out what a site actually uses, from a
desktop machine:

    openssl s_client -connect HOST:443 -servername HOST -showcerts

and add the root it names to `/etc/ca.pem`. Keep the file small: every
certificate in it is parsed on each connection, out of the same memory
the packet buffers use. Nine roots is comfortable; the full browser set
of about 150 is far too big and will not load at all.

## Serving

There is a small web server:

    # mkdir /tmp/www
    # cd /tmp/www
    # echo hello > index.html
    # httpd &

It serves files from the directory it was started in, on port 8080, one
connection at a time. `httpd 80` to choose the port. `/` is
`index.html`, a missing file is a 404, and a path containing `..` is
refused.

There is also a TFTP server, which is the quicker way to move a file
when the other machine is not a browser:

    # mkdir /tmp/pub
    # cp hello.bas /tmp/pub
    # tftpd /tmp/pub &

and from anywhere else, in either direction:

    curl -o hello.bas tftp://192.168.1.245/hello.bas
    curl -T new.bas   tftp://192.168.1.245/new.bas

Every router and workstation already has a TFTP client, which is the
point of it. `tftpd -r` refuses writes; `tftpd -q` says nothing. It
serves the directory it was started in unless given another, a path
containing `..` is refused, and a write replaces any file of that
name — so serve a directory you are willing to have written to.
There is no authentication anywhere in TFTP.

**Stop them before you flash or reboot.** A running server holds the
filesystem open, so `remount -n / ro` will refuse, and the disc goes
down dirty:

    # ps                 find its pid - the shell has no job numbers
    # kill 1234

## Talking to yourself

The machine can reach its own servers, either through `127.0.0.1` or
through its own address:

    # htget http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html got.htm

## When it does not work

**`no radio (Pico Computer 2)`** — the machine has no Wi-Fi. Nothing to
be done.

**`NETIOC_STATUS: Not a typewriter`** — the kernel has no networking in
it. From v0.18 there is only one kernel and it always does, so this
means an older kernel, or a card newer than the kernel it is running
on. Flash the matching `fuzix.uf2`.

**`connect: Connection refused` from `tlsget`** — with certificates
being checked, this is what a failed certificate looks like as well as
what a genuinely refused connection looks like. Try `tlsca -n` and
connect again: if it works then, the certificate is the problem and the
site's root is missing from your bundle.

**Names do not resolve but addresses work** — `/etc/resolv.conf` is
written by `wifi -f`. If you joined with `wifi SSID KEY` instead, it
was not written.

**It joined but nothing works** — check `wifi` for the link status and
`ping` your gateway before blaming anything further away.

# Commands at the `#` prompt {#shell-commands}

The shell is the Bourne shell and the machine underneath it is a
V7-style Unix, so most of what you know already works. This chapter is
about the rest: the programs that exist because this is a Pico Computer
rather than a PDP-11, and the handful of places where the tools have
been brought forward from 1979.

Everything named here is on the card. That is checked rather than
promised — `mancheck.sh` extracts every command name from this chapter
and the next and looks for it in the built image, and the release will
not go out if one is missing. The list used to be maintained by hand
and had drifted badly: it offered a games collection of some thirty
titles, an editor called `ue`, and an assembler, none of which were
ever installed.

**One thing you know that does not work here: options come before
operands.** `getopt` is the System V one and stops at the first
argument that is not an option, so `ping 8.8.8.8 -c 3` reads `-c 3` as
two more operands and ignores them. GNU's `getopt` shuffles the
arguments before the program sees them, so the habit is invisible
until it crosses to this machine — and what you get is not an error
but a plausible wrong answer. `ntpdate` and `tftpd` refuse a misplaced
option; the rest of the suite still ignores one quietly. See
[Setting the clock](#ntp-clock) for the case that found it.

## The machine itself: `picoctl`

Everything the kernel will do on request that has no better home.

```
# picoctl flash                  reboot into the UF2 bootloader
# picoctl keymap uk              us uk de fr es be
# picoctl mode 2                 set the display mode
# picoctl mode                   ... and back to the 80x40 text console
# picoctl usbreset               re-enumerate after the DPDT switch
# picoctl numlock                report
# picoctl numlock off            for the keyboard plugged in now
# picoctl numlock on 04b3:3025   for one that is not
# picoctl numlock off --once     change it without saving
# picoctl numlock --load         replay the saved settings (/etc/rc does this)
```

`picoctl flash` is the polite way to reach the bootloader: `sync`,
`remount -n / ro`, `sync`, then `picoctl flash`, and the drive appears
without anyone touching the board.

**Num lock is a property of the keyboard, not of the machine.** A
keyboard with no numeric keypad usually overlays one onto
`7890/uiop/jkl;/m` while num lock is on, and its own firmware does that
from the LED report the host sends. Nothing in the USB descriptors
distinguishes such a keyboard — a Raspberry Pi keyboard and a full-size
Lenovo return byte-identical HID report descriptors — so the setting is
remembered per keyboard in `/etc/numlock`, written when you change it
and replayed by `/etc/rc`. That is why it survives a reboot and why
each of your keyboards keeps its own answer.

## Pictures

These four are the programs `SAVE IMAGE`, `LOAD IMAGE`, `LOAD JPG` and
`LOAD PNG` run, and they are just as useful typed at the prompt. All
of them want a graphics mode — `picoctl mode 2` if you are at the text
console.

```
# saveimage shot.bmp                     the whole screen
# saveimage part.bmp 160 120 320 240     x y w h
# loadimage shot.bmp                     at 0,0
# loadimage tiger.bmp 0 0 0 64 0        x y mode ximage yimage
# loadjpg photo.jpg                      at 0,0
# loadjpg photo.jpg 0 0 0 0 0 2          binned 2:1, so 640x480 fits
# loadpng logo.png 40 20                 at x,y
# loadpng logo.png 0 0 -1                let the screen show through
# loadpng -s logo.png > logo.spr         decode to a SPRITE, on stdout
# loadimage -s ship.bmp > ship.spr       the same, from a BMP
# loadimage -s sheet.bmp 64 0 16 16      one 16x16 tile out of a sheet
```

The full argument lists, which are MMBasic's:

| | |
|---|---|
| `saveimage` | `file.bmp [x y w h]` |
| `loadimage` | `file.bmp [x [y [mode [ximage [yimage]]]]]` |
| `loadimage -s` | `file.bmp [xorigin [yorigin [width [height]]]]` |
| `loadjpg` | `file.jpg [x [y [mode [ximage [yimage [scale]]]]]]` |
| `loadpng` | `file.png [x [y [transparent [cutoff]]]]` |
| `loadpng -s` | `file.png [transparent [cutoff]]` |

`ximage`/`yimage` are the offset **into the picture**, so a large image
can be cropped rather than scaled. `saveimage` writes a 24-bit BMP of
any rectangle. `loadimage` is MMBasic's own BMP decoder and reads
1/4/8/16/24/32-bit files, `BI_BITFIELDS` and RLE4/RLE8, dithering only
when asked.

**`transparent` defaults to 0, which is palette black**, so a PNG with
a transparent surround draws a black box on a white screen. That looks
like a bug and is not — a real PicoMite does the same, and the default
is chosen so that `SPRITE LOADPNG` and `SPRITE SHOW`, which both treat
index 0 as see-through, meet in the middle. Pass **-1** to let the
screen show through instead. `cutoff` is the alpha above which a pixel
counts as opaque.

`loadjpg` decodes a block at a time, so its memory does not grow with
the picture. `loadpng` cannot work that way — PNG filters refer to the
row above and the whole image must be inflated first — so it takes the
big buffers from the PSRAM arena and costs the process pool nothing.

The `-s` form of either loader needs no graphics mode at all: it writes
the decoded sprite to standard output as two 16-bit sizes followed by
one colour index per byte. That is how `SPRITE LOADPNG` and `SPRITE
LOADBMP` work, and it is also the way to convert artwork from the
shell.

`loadimage -s` takes a **window** rather than a position — `xorigin`,
`yorigin`, `width`, `height`, all of the picture from that point by
default — because that is what `SPRITE LOADBMP` takes, and cutting one
tile out of a sheet is most of what it is for. A window that runs off
the picture is refused (`Coordinates`, the reference's own word) rather
than quietly clipped.

**Neither `-s` form dithers**, and that is deliberate: MMBasic's screen
path quantises with error in mind, its sprite path takes red's top bit,
green's top two and blue's top bit, and so do these. A sprite is data
that gets blitted about, and a dithered one changes colour when it
moves.

## Sound

```
# playmp3 track.mp3            volume 80 by default
# playmp3 track.mp3 40         0 to 100
# playmp3 track.mp3 &          in the background, and carry on working
# playwav clip.wav 60
# playflac album.flac
# playmod tune.mod 70          MOD, and it loops
# playmod tune.mod 70 noloop   ... or plays once
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `playmp3`, `playwav`, `playflac` | `file [volume 0-100]` |
| `playmod` | `file.mod [volume] [noloop]` |

These are what `PLAY MP3`, `PLAY WAV`, `PLAY FLAC` and `PLAY MODFILE`
run. **One plays at a time**: a second is refused by name and pid
rather than allowed to talk over the first. Stop one with `kill -2`,
or `PLAY STOP` from BASIC. `playmp3` decodes at about six times real
time and leaves most of the machine to whatever else is running.

`PLAY SOUND` and `PLAY TONE` have no command-line equivalent — the
synthesiser lives in the kernel's DAC interrupt and is reached through
`/dev/sys`.

## Languages and the toolchain

Each of these has a chapter of its own; this is the summary.

```
# cc prog.c                     -> prog.bc, and run it with ./prog.bc
# cc prog.bas                   BASIC in one step, via mmbc
# cc -r prog.bas                ... and run it if it built
# mmbc prog.bas                 -> prog.c, and stop there
# bcdump prog.bc                disassemble the bytecode
# bbcbasic                      BBC BASIC, with its own editor
# fforth                        a complete ANS Forth
# dc                            the V7 desk calculator
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `cc` | `[-o out] [-v] [-k] [-Ldir] file.c \| file.bas` |
| `mmbc` | `source.bas [-o out.c] [--report] [--strict] [--fcc]` |
| `bcdump` | `file.bc` |

`cc prog.bas` is the whole build in one command: it runs `mmbc` first
and writes `prog.mb.c`, a deliberately different name from `prog.c` so
that compiling `prog.bas` can never overwrite C you wrote yourself.
That file is deleted again with the other intermediates, so the
shortcut leaves no C behind: pass `-k` to keep it, or run `mmbc` on its
own when the generated C is what you are after.
`mmbc --report` lists implied globals and any line it could not
translate; `--strict` stops on the first of them instead of commenting
it out and carrying on.

`bcrun` executes a `.bc` file, and is what the `#!`-less `./prog.bc`
actually invokes.

Three environment variables change what `cc` builds, all described
in [When a program will not start](#thumb-budget): `THUMB_BUDGET`
caps the native code so a large program still fits its process,
`THUMB_VERBOSE` reports what translated and what did not, and
`BCODE_ONLY` gives up native code altogether.

## The manual pages

Every command in this chapter has a manual page on the card, and `man`
shows it:

```
# man sed                     the page for sed
# man 2 open                  section 2, the system calls
# man -w awk                  where the page is, and do not show it
```

`man` pipes into `more`, so `q` leaves and any other key goes on. It is
not `nroff` — it has its own formatter built in, and understands the
subset of `-man` the pages here are written in.

The pages describe **the programs on this card**, not the GNU ones of
the same names, and where they differ that is the first thing each page
says. Some of those differences will bite:

* `rm` silently ignores any argument beginning with `-`, so `rm -rf
  junk` removes a file called `junk` and says nothing about the rest.
* `killall` takes no process name. It signals everything except `init`,
  itself and its parent.
* `ssh` is a small shell, not a remote login.
* `cat` has no options at all.
* `expr` spells equality `==`; a plain `=` is a syntax error.
* `sed` has no `\{n,m\}`, and treats it as literal text rather than
  complaining.

Section 2 holds the system calls, which is what you want when writing C
on the machine: `man 2 open`, `man 2 read`, `man 2 fork`.

## Editors

```
# mmbedit prog.bas         MMBasic's own, with its function keys
# vi hello.c              levee, a compact vi
# ed                      the V7 line editor, still here
```

`mmbedit` is described in its own chapter. `vi` and `levee` are two
names for one program.

## Getting files on and off

```
# fat ls                       list the FAT partition
# fat ls basic                 ... a directory of it
# fat get "my program.bas" /root/prog.bas
# fat put results.txt          ... and back the other way
# fat info
# uue report.txt               -> report.uue, to paste into a terminal
# uud prog.uue                 decode, recreating the original name
# rx file                      XMODEM in, over /dev/tty2
# sx file                      ... and out
# dosread                      FAT12/16 floppy-era transfers
# tar                          the classic archiver
```

`fat` takes `[-d device]` before its subcommand. The FAT partition is
the one Windows can see, so it is the easy way to move a file to or
from a PC; `uue`/`uud` need nothing but the console, and have a chapter of
their own.

## Networking

See [Networking](#networking) for what these do and how to set the
machine up. On a Pico Computer 2 they are all present, and `wifi` will
tell you there is no radio.

```
# wifi                         what the radio is doing
# wifi -f                      join the network in /etc/wifi.conf
# wifi MYSSID MYKEY            join without using the file
# wifi -d                      disconnect
# ntpdate -s time.cloudflare.com   set the clock (-s, or it only prints)
# ping -c 4 8.8.8.8            ICMP, with round-trip times
# dig example.com              look up a name
# htget http://host/page f     fetch a page over HTTP into f
# tlsget 1.2.3.4 host /        fetch over TLS (address, then name)
# tlsca /etc/ca.pem            check certificates from now on
# tlsca -n                     ... and stop checking
# httpd &                      serve this directory on port 8080
# httpd 80 &                   ... on a port of your choosing
# tftpd &                      serve this directory over TFTP
# tftpd -r /tmp/pub &          ... a chosen directory, reads only
```

## The clock, and housekeeping

```
# setdate                      show the time
# setdate -w                   write the system time to the DS3231
# setdate -u                   ask for a new one
# df                           space
# free                         memory, and what the swapper took
# ps                           processes
# uptime                       how long since the last boot
# mount                        what is mounted
# umount /dev/hda3             ... and unmount it
# remount -n / ro              read-only, before flashing
# fsck /dev/hda2               check a filesystem
# sync                         flush the buffers
# shutdown                     the tidy way to stop
# halt                         ... and the blunt one
# reboot                       start again
```

`setdate -a` is the non-interactive form `/etc/rc` uses: it reads the
DS3231 and gives up rather than prompting if there is nothing to read.
`setdate -0` says that what you type is standard time, with no
daylight-saving adjustment.

`remount -n / ro` is worth doing before anything that might crash, not
only before flashing: a crash with the root read-only costs a power
cycle and you are back at the prompt, where the same crash with it
read-write means waiting through `fsck` on the next boot. **`mount`
will not confirm that it took** — it reports `read-write` either way.
The honest check is to try to write something: `touch x` fails while
the root is read-only, and succeeds once `remount -n / rw` has put it
back.
`swapon` exists but has nothing to do: there is no swap device any
more, because the kernel takes an allocation the size of the process
out of PSRAM when it needs to swap one out. `free` reports that.

`setboot`, `prtroot` and `substroot` choose and report which partition
the kernel boots from — see Appendix B.

## Where this is not 1979

Fuzix is a V7-style Unix and most of the userland is period-correct.
These are the places it is deliberately not, and they are worth knowing
because they are what makes shell work on the machine bearable.

* **`awk` is Lucent's one true awk** — the maintained descendant of the
  V7 original, by one of its authors, not a subset. Associative
  arrays, user-defined functions, `getline` in each of its forms,
  output pipes, dynamic regular expressions, `printf` and the maths
  library. See [Text processing](#text-processing).
* **The C library can print a fraction.** `printf("%f", x)` used to
  print the letter `f`. `%e`, `%f` and `%g` work now, in `printf` and
  `scanf`, and so do `%j` and `%z`. A bytecode program's `printf`
  gained `%e` and `%g` too, where before they printed themselves *and*
  misaligned every argument after them.
* **`[` exists.** `/bin/test` was there and `/bin/[` was not, so every
  bracket test in every shell script failed with `[: not found`.
* **`sed`, `find`, `expr`, `seq` and `uname`** were all being compiled
  and simply never installed. They are installed.
* **`grep -q`, `ls -t` and `ls -1`** — small additions, and the ones a
  script reaches for first.
* **`mmbedit`** is not a Unix tool at all: it is MMBasic's own
  full-screen editor, keyword colouring and function keys included.

**What is still period-correct**, so that a script does not surprise
you: `grep` has basic regular expressions only and no `-E`; `sed` is
MINIX's, with no `-E`; `sort` uses the V7 key syntax `+beg -end`
rather than `-k`; `diff` has no `-u`. The table in
[Text processing](#text-processing) has the detail.

## What is not here

A short list, because a manual that names a command the card does not
have wastes more of your time than one that stays quiet.

There is no `less`, `make`, `m4`, `factor`, `units` or `mail`, and no
assembler. `/usr/games` holds `advent` — the original Colossal Cave —
and `cowsay`, and that is all: the Scott Adams, Mysterious Adventures
and Z-machine collections are not installed. There is no network, so
`ssh` cannot do anything useful. `man` is present and so are its
pages, in `/usr/man/man1`.

# The filesystem and included software

## Layout

```
/bin          core utilities, and picoctl, fat, uue/uud, setdate
/usr/bin      the toolchain, BBC BASIC, the editors, the media tools
/usr/games    advent and cowsay
/usr/lib/cc   the C compiler passes, and its headers in include/
/usr/man      manual pages (man <name>)
/dev          devices - see below
/etc          rc (boot script), inittab, passwd, termcap
/tmp          scratch space
/root         root's home directory
```

Key devices:

| Device      | What it is                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `/dev/tty1` | The console (HDMI + USB keyboard + serial mirror) |
| `/dev/tty2` | The GP0/GP1 serial port                          |
| `/dev/hda1`–`hda15` | SD card partitions (root is `hda2`)      |
| `/dev/hdb`  | The PSRAM disc, used for swap                    |
| `/dev/rtc`  | The DS3231 clock (`setdate` reads and sets it)   |
| `/dev/sys`  | Platform control (graphics, sound, ADVAL ioctls) |

`/etc/rc` runs at boot: filesystem check, clock from the DS3231,
keyboard layout. Edit it with any of the editors below.

There is no swap device to enable. The PSRAM is not a block device
any more: the kernel takes an allocation the size of the process
when it needs to swap one out, and programs take their heap from
the same place. `free` reports both.

## Applications

The programs that make this machine what it is have a chapter of their
own: [Commands at the `#` prompt](#shell-commands) covers
`picoctl`, the image and sound players, the toolchain, the editors and
the file-transfer tools, with their arguments.

**Shell and core:** Bourne `sh` and the classic set — `ls ll cp mv ln
rm mkdir rmdir cat more head tail grep fgrep sed awk tr cut sort uniq
wc find xargs diff diff3 cmp comm join split rev tar dd df du free ps
kill killall uptime date cal banner echo sleep tee touch which who su
passwd stty mount umount sync fsck mkfs fdisk chmod chown chgrp od seq
dc expr test uname cron at write wall` — and more, so `ls /bin
/usr/bin` is the authority rather than this paragraph.

**Games** (`/usr/games`): `advent`, the original Colossal Cave, and
`cowsay`.

## Text processing {#text-processing}

`awk` is Lucent's — the one true awk, the maintained descendant of the
V7 original by one of its authors. It is the real thing rather than a
subset: associative arrays, user-defined functions, `getline` in each
of its forms, output pipes, dynamic regular expressions, `printf`, and
the maths library.

```
# awk '{ s[$1] += $2 } END { for (k in s) printf "%-10s %6.2f\n", k, s[k] }' log
# ps | awk 'NR > 1 { n++ } END { print n " processes" }'
```

With `sed`, `grep` and `find` alongside it the usual pipelines work:

```
# find /bin -name 'a*' | sed 's|/bin/||' | awk '{ print NR, $1 }'
```

**What these are not.** They are period tools and they show it in
places, so it is worth knowing where before a script surprises you:

| | |
|---|---|
| `grep` | basic regular expressions only. `-c -e -i -l -n -q -s -v`, and no `-E`; use `awk` for an extended regex, or `fgrep` for a fixed string. |
| `sed`   | MINIX's. Substitution, `-n`, several `-e`, and back-references all work; no `-E`. |
| `sort`  | the V7 key syntax, `+beg_pos -end_pos`, not `-k`. |
| `diff`  | V7 — no `-u`, so no unified diffs. |
| `ls`    | `-t` sorts a *directory* by time, newest first; command-line arguments are listed in the order you gave them, as they always have been. |
| `test`  | and `[`, which are one program under two names. `-a -b -c -d -e -f -g -n -o -p -r -s -t -u -w -x -z`. |

# Appendix B: boot options

The kernel command line (held by the bootloader) accepts:

* `hda2` … — root device override (partition 2 of the SD card)
* `kbd=us|uk|de|fr|es|be` — early keyboard layout override (the
  layout in `/etc/rc` then applies for the session)

# Appendix C: MMBasic coverage

This is what `mmbc` translates today. It is generated from the
translator's own tables (`Applications/mmb2c/fcc/coverage.py`), so
it says what the program does rather than what anyone remembers it
doing.

Coverage grows with each release, and it will never be complete.
MMBasic is a large language whose statements reach deep into one
particular firmware, and a translator that emits portable C cannot
follow all of it. Anything not listed here is reported by name, with
its line number, and the translation continues - so you find out at
translate time, not at run time.

## MATH() sub-functions

Scalar: `ATAN3`, `COSH`, `LOG10`, `SINH`, `TANH`

Whole-array (one number out of an array): `MAX`, `MEAN`, `MEDIAN`, `MIN`, `SD`, `SUM`

Vector, matrix and signal:

| | |
|---|---|
| `MATH(MAGNITUDE a())` | the square root of the sum of the squares. Any rank: a two-dimensional array is read as the flat vector it is |
| `MATH(DOTPRODUCT a(), b())` | the sum of the products. One-dimensional, and the same length |
| `MATH(M_DETERMINANT a())` | of a square two-dimensional array |
| `MATH(CROSSING a() [, level] [, direction] [, confirm])` | where a signal first crosses `level`, or -1 |

`CROSSING` defaults to a level of 0, a direction of 1 (upward; -1 is
downward) and a confirm window of 1. The window is what rejects a
single-sample spike: the crossing is only reported if the signal stays
on the far side for that many samples. Two things about it are worth
knowing before you use it. **What comes back is an offset from the
first element, not a subscript** - under `OPTION BASE 1` you want
`a(found + 1)`. And a crossing too near the end of the array to confirm
**ends** the search rather than being skipped, so a late spike hides a
real crossing after it. Both are the interpreter's behaviour.

Codecs: `MATH(BASE64 ENCODE|DECODE in$, out$)`, which returns the length
and writes its answer into the second argument, and the four CRCs.

### The CRCs

    MATH(CRC8  v [,length [,polynomial [,startmask [,endmask [,reverseIn [,reverseOut]]]]]])
    MATH(CRC12 v ...)
    MATH(CRC16 v ...)
    MATH(CRC32 v ...)

`v` is a string or a one-dimensional numeric array — an integer array or
a float array, each element being one byte. An element above 255 is an
error (`Variable > 255`); a negative one is cast to a byte in silence,
as the interpreter casts it. A `length` of 0, or no `length` at all,
means the whole of it.

Everything after `v` has a default, and an **empty** argument takes its
default too, so `MATH(CRC16 a$, , , &HFFFF)` sets only the start mask:

| width | polynomial | start | end | reverses | range of the three masks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CRC8` | `&H07` | 0 | 0 | off | 0..255 |
| `CRC12` | `&H80D` | 0 | 0 | off | 0..4095 |
| `CRC16` | `&H1021` | 0 | 0 | off | 0..65535 |
| `CRC32` | `&H4C11DB7` | 0 | 0 | off | 0..&HFFFFFFFF |

The published catalogue forms are all reachable, and these are the
values every CRC specification quotes for the string `123456789`:

| | |
|---|---|
| `MATH(CRC16 s$)` | `&H31C3` — CRC-16/XMODEM |
| `MATH(CRC16 s$, , , &HFFFF)` | `&H29B1` — CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE |
| `MATH(CRC16 s$, , &H8005, , , 1, 1)` | `&HBB3D` — CRC-16/ARC |
| `MATH(CRC32 s$, , , &HFFFFFFFF, &HFFFFFFFF, 1, 1)` | `&HCBF43926` — the zip and PNG CRC |

**Three deliberate differences from PicoMite 6.03.00**, agreed with its
author, who is correcting the interpreter. Until that reaches a release,
a side-by-side will differ here and nowhere else.

* `CRC12` is masked to 12 bits. The interpreter never masks it, so its
  answer carries a junk top nibble: `&HFEFB` there against `&HEFB` here,
  and `&HEFB` is the canonical value.
* `reverseOut` is read from the seventh argument. All four branches of
  the interpreter test for a seventh argument and then read the sixth,
  so `reverseOut` cannot be reached there at all — which is why the
  reflected forms above are not available on a PicoMite today.
* The end mask is applied **after** the output reversal, for all four
  widths. The interpreter does it in that order for `CRC12` and `CRC16`
  and the other way round for `CRC8` and `CRC32`; reverse-then-XOR is
  what every published CRC means. With the default end mask of 0 the two
  orders agree, so this shows only when a program passes both an end
  mask and `reverseOut`.

## MATH sub-commands

`MATH` is also a statement, and that is a different and much longer list
in the interpreter. Thirty-two of it are translated. The element-by-
element ones are what most programs use it for:

| | |
|---|---|
| `MATH SET v, a()` | every element of `a()` becomes `v` |
| `MATH ADD a(), v, b()` | `b() = a() + v`, element by element |
| `MATH SCALE a(), v, b()` | `b() = a() * v`, element by element |
| `MATH POWER a(), v, b()` | `b() = a() ^ v`, element by element |
| `MATH SHIFT a%(), n, b%() [, U]` | shift each element left by `n`, or right by `-n` |
| `MATH RANDOMIZE [seed]` | seed the generator; no seed uses the clock |
| `MATH SLICE a(), i, , k, b()` | copy one line of `a()` into `b()` |
| `MATH INSERT a(), i, , k, b()` | copy `b()` back into that line |
| `MATH C_ADD a(), b(), c()` | `c() = a() + b()`, element by element |
| `MATH WINDOW a(), lo, hi, b() [, min, max]` | rescale `a()` onto `lo`..`hi` |

`C_SUB`, `C_MUL`, `C_MULT`, `C_DIV`, `C_AND`, `C_OR` and `C_XOR` are the
same shape as `C_ADD` — the `C_` is for component, not complex — and all
eight need the three arrays to be the same type and the same length.

`SET`, `ADD`, `SLICE` and `INSERT` take integer, float or string arrays;
`SCALE` and `POWER` are numeric only, as they are there, and `SHIFT` is
integers only. `ARRAY` is accepted as a spelling of `MATH` for `SET`,
`ADD`, `SLICE` and `INSERT`, and `ARRAY SLICE` and `ARRAY INSERT` are
the spellings the manual uses — the interpreter runs both through the
same two functions. **It is not a spelling of the rest**: `ARRAY SCALE`
answers `Unknown command` on a real PicoMite, because `SCALE` and
everything below it live only in `cmd_math`.

Three of these have a detail that will bite a program written from the
name alone, and all three are the interpreter's own:

* `MATH SHIFT`'s fourth argument is a **bare** `U`, not `"U"`. Quoted,
  a real PicoMite ignores it and gives you the arithmetic shift; we
  refuse the quoted form rather than do that quietly.
* `MATH POWER` into an **integer** array rounds the exponent to a whole
  number first, so `POWER a%(), 2.7, b%()` cubes. Into a float array it
  does not.
* `MATH WINDOW` into an **integer** array truncates toward zero, where
  everything else that lands a float in an integer rounds: 1 to 5
  windowed onto 0..10 gives `0 2 5 7 10`, not `0 3 5 8 10`.

### Vectors, matrices and quaternions

The rest are the linear algebra, and they read a two-dimensional array
the way the interpreter does: **`dims[0]` is the column count and
`dims[1]` the row count**, so an array is `a(col, row)` and a row is
contiguous. `DIM p(3,2)` is three wide and two tall. Writing
`a(row, col)` gets you the transpose of what you meant, on a real
PicoMite as much as here.

| | |
|---|---|
| `MATH V_NORMALISE a(), b()` | `b()` is `a()` scaled to unit length |
| `MATH V_CROSS a(), b(), c()` | the cross product; three elements each |
| `MATH V_MULT a(), b(), c()` | a matrix by a vector |
| `MATH V_ROTATE ox, oy, ang, xi(), yi(), xo(), yo()` | rotate points about an origin |
| `MATH V_PRINT a()` / `MATH M_PRINT a()` | print a vector or a matrix |
| `MATH M_TRANSPOSE a(), b()` | `b()` is `a()` transposed |
| `MATH M_MULT a(), b(), c()` | matrix multiply |
| `MATH M_INVERSE a(), b()` | `b()` is the inverse of a square `a()` |
| `MATH Q_CREATE theta, x, y, z, q()` | a rotation about an axis |
| `MATH Q_EULER yaw, pitch, roll, q()` | from Euler angles |
| `MATH Q_VECTOR x, y, z, q()` | a vector as a quaternion |
| `MATH Q_INVERT q(), n()` | the conjugate |
| `MATH Q_MULT q1(), q2(), n()` | quaternion multiply |
| `MATH Q_ROTATE q(), v(), n()` | rotate `v()` by `q()` |

A **quaternion here is five floats, not four**: `w`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and
a magnitude carried alongside. The first four are always normalised and
element 4 holds the scale that was taken out, which is why
`MATH Q_VECTOR 3, 4, 12, q()` answers a unit direction and `13`, and
why `Q_ROTATE` hands the same `13` back. Every one of them refuses an
array that is not exactly five long.

`V_ROTATE` respects `OPTION ANGLE`, as `Q_CREATE` and `Q_EULER` do, and
takes four arrays of one type - float or integer. The interpreter
accepts any mix of the two; this does not.

The inverse and the determinant use the interpreter's own cofactor
expansion rather than a factorisation, so their last digits agree with
it. That is O(n!), and the practical ceiling here is an 8x8.

**One shape works here that a PicoMite cannot express.** MMBasic keeps
an array's rank in the same table entry as its bounds, where 0 means
"not an array", so no dimension can have an extent of 1 under either
`OPTION BASE`: `DIM a(0)` is refused under BASE 0 and `DIM a(1)` under
BASE 1. We keep the rank separately, so `DIM c(0,0)` is an honest 1x1
matrix and a row vector times a column vector lands in one. A program
that wants the number rather than the matrix should say
`MATH(DOTPRODUCT)`, which is the same arithmetic and returns one — and
a program that uses an extent-1 dimension will not run on a PicoMite,
failing at the `DIM` rather than at the `MATH`.

### Slicing an array

A **slice** is one line through an array of two or more dimensions. Give
every index but one; the line runs along the one left blank, and the
array it is copied to or from is one-dimensional and the same length.

```basic
DIM a(3, 4, 5), b(4)
ARRAY SLICE  a(), 2, , 3, b()    ' b() = a(2,0,3), a(2,1,3), ... a(2,4,3)
b(0) = 99
ARRAY INSERT a(), 2, , 3, b()    ' and back again
```

It is far quicker than the equivalent `FOR` loop, and that is the reason
it exists: the elements of the line are a fixed distance apart, so the
copy is a single stride and the index arithmetic is done once at
translate time rather than once per element. `OPTION BASE` is respected
on both sides. A length that does not match is
`Size mismatch between slice and target array`, as in the interpreter.

One difference to know about: MMBasic converts between integer and float
arrays here, and this does not — both arrays must be the same type, the
same rule `ARRAY ADD` already follows.

The rest are not translated, and each says so by name rather than being
mistaken for something else: the matrix operations (`M_MULT`,
`M_INVERSE`, `M_TRANSPOSE`, `M_PRINT`), the vector ones (`V_MULT`,
`V_CROSS`, `V_NORMALISE`, `V_ROTATE`, `V_PRINT`), the quaternions
(`Q_CREATE`, `Q_EULER`, `Q_INVERT`, `Q_MULT`, `Q_ROTATE`, `Q_VECTOR`),
the complex arithmetic (`C_ADD`, `C_SUB`, `C_MUL`, `C_DIV`, `C_AND`,
`C_OR`, `C_XOR`), `FFT`, `WINDOW`, `SINC`, `INTERPOLATE`, `POWER`,
`SHIFT`, `PID`, `SENSORFUSION` and `AES128`.

They are a coherent block of work rather than a scattering of gaps —
most are pure arithmetic over arrays with no hardware in them, so they
would go in as a header of static functions and cost nothing to a
program that does not use them.

## Types and structure

`INTEGER` (64-bit), `FLOAT` (double), `STRING`, and arrays of each, up
to the dimensions MMBasic allows. `DIM`, `LOCAL`, `STATIC`, `CONST`,
`OPTION BASE`, `SUB` and `FUNCTION` with by-reference arguments, and
the usual control flow.

**`DIM s$(n) LENGTH m` sets the SPACING of the elements**, not just a
cap on each. The firmware places element `k` at `base + k * (m + 1)`,
and a program is entitled to that: PETSCII Robots keeps its 128x64
world map as `DIM LV$(63) LENGTH 128` and reads tiles straight out of
it with `PEEK(BYTE (y) * 129 + x + lva)`, where the 129 *is* the
`LENGTH`. So an array honours it, and an element is then the
firmware's own layout — a length byte and `LENGTH` characters, with no
room for the trailing NUL the runtime normally keeps. That is handled
for you; the one visible consequence is that such an array cannot be
passed whole to a `SUB` or to `SORT`, because the runtime's array
helpers step at the full string size. Index it instead, or leave the
`LENGTH` off. On a *scalar* `LENGTH` is still only a cap, since a
scalar's layout cannot differ.

**Structures** (MMBasic's `TYPE ... END TYPE`, documented in full in
the PicoMite structures manual) are translated with the firmware's
byte layout reproduced exactly — `STRUCT(SIZEOF "t")` answers the
same number here and on a PicoMite. Members may be `INTEGER`, `INT`,
`FLOAT`, `STRING [LENGTH n]`, arrays of those, or an earlier TYPE;
member access works to the full nesting depth
(`data(2).items(1).values(4)` included), structure variables, arrays,
`LOCAL`s and by-reference parameters all work, whole structures
assign with `=`, and `STRUCT COPY`, `STRUCT CLEAR` and `STRUCT SWAP`
are in. `STRUCT(SIZEOF/OFFSET/TYPE)` fold to constants when the names
are literal strings.

Not translated (each says so rather than mistranslating):
`STRUCT SORT/SAVE/LOAD/PRINT/EXTRACT/INSERT`, `STRUCT(FIND)`, a
`FUNCTION` returning a structure, whole structure arrays as
parameters, and initialisers on structure arrays. Assigning a whole
structure into or out of a *nested* member is refused deliberately:
the interpreter copies the outer type's size there and overruns
memory, and a clean error beats reproducing that.

## Errors, and surviving them

In a program that uses `ON ERROR`, every error it can hit is a check
the runtime makes *before* it does the thing — the same order the
interpreter uses. Nothing is left to the hardware to notice: dividing
by zero as a float would otherwise answer `inf` rather than stopping,
and this processor does not trap integer division by zero at all.

A program with no `ON ERROR` anywhere is compiled without the
arithmetic checks — see "What `ON ERROR` costs" below. Its float
divisions and `SQR`/`LOG`/`ASIN`/`ACOS` take what C gives: `inf` or
`nan`, flowing onward through the sums. There is no sensible recovery
from arithmetic like that — the program has a bug to fix either way —
so the choice is between stopping with a message (a trapping program)
and full speed (everything else). Integer division and `MOD` are the
exception, checked in every program: C leaves integer division by zero
undefined, and the silent zero this processor answers is not a number
to limp onward with.

`ON ERROR SKIP [n]`, `ON ERROR IGNORE`, `ON ERROR CLEAR` and
`ON ERROR ABORT` work as they do on a PicoMite, with `MM.ERRNO` and
`MM.ERRMSG$` reporting what happened. A statement that fails while an
error is being skipped is abandoned where it failed: the assignment does
not happen, the rest of the `PRINT` does not print, and execution
resumes at the next statement — in the `SUB` it happened in, if that is
where it was. The count works as it does there too, `SKIP n` covering
the next n statements.

Two details that surprise people, both matching the interpreter. A
`PRINT` that fails part way through prints **nothing at all** — not even
the items before the failure — because the line is built whole and the
error discards it. And calling a `SUB` spends skip count: the `SUB` line
and any `LOCAL` are statements too, so `ON ERROR SKIP 2` before a call
does not reach the third statement inside it.

Two limits worth knowing. A statement that jumps away (`GOTO`, `EXIT`)
does not count against `SKIP n`, so a count that spans one runs one
statement further than it would on a PicoMite. And running out of memory
ends the program whatever `ON ERROR` says — there is nothing sensible to
carry on with, and a program limping along on a failed allocation would
fail somewhere far less obvious.

`ON ERROR RESTART` reboots the machine on a PicoMite; a compiled program
has no equivalent, so `mmbc` refuses it by name rather than guessing.

### What `ON ERROR` costs

The checks are real work in real loops. With `ON ERROR` present, every
float division whose divisor is not a nonzero literal becomes a runtime
call that tests the divisor first, and `SQR`, `LOG`, `ASIN` and `ACOS`
go through checked wrappers instead of straight to libm — that is what
makes their errors trappable statements. Measured on the machine from a
fresh boot: the grains benchmark, whose inner loop divides by a
variable and takes a logarithm every pass, pays about 12%; the solar
eclipse predictor, dominated by plain arithmetic, about 2%. The string
checks (concatenation past 255 characters, `ASC` of an empty string)
are part of string calls that happen anyway and stay on in every
program; they cost a comparison, not a call.

`ON ERROR` earns its keep trapping things that genuinely can fail at
run time — an I2C transfer that may not be acknowledged, a file that
may not exist — not arithmetic. If a program traps errors out of
habit, leaving `ON ERROR` out buys the checks back.

### I2C2 — the second controller

`I2C2` is MMBasic's second bus, and on this machine it is the one a
program may have. The fixed bus (`I2C`, GP20/GP21) is the QWIIC socket
*and* the DS3231 the system clock runs on, which the kernel polls from
interrupt context, so it stays the kernel's.

```basic
SETPIN 38, 39, I2C2          ' GP38/GP39 or GP42/GP43 - see below
I2C2 OPEN 400, 1000          ' speed kHz, timeout ms
I2C2 WRITE &H77, 1, 1, &HD0  ' option 1 = HOLD: no STOP
I2C2 READ  &H77, 0, 1, r$    ' ...so this is a repeated START
I2C2 CLOSE
```

The pins are not free to choose: the RP2350 muxes I2C1's SDA only onto
pins where `pin AND 3 = 2` and SCL only where `pin AND 3 = 3`, so on
this board the pairs are **GP38/GP39** and **GP42/GP43**. Anything else
is refused at `OPEN` rather than producing a bus that never answers.

**The data arguments are the same on all three buses**, which is worth
learning once. `WRITE` takes a list of byte expressions, a whole
numeric array written `a()`, a string, or a long string written
`LONGSTRING a()`. `READ` takes any of those, and also **a list of
variables, one per byte received**:

```basic
I2C2 READ &H77, 0, 3, hi, mid, lo
```

MMBasic reaches one implementation of these from `I2C`, `SPI` and
`ONEWIRE` alike, and so does this — learn them here and they work
there. The string forms are what MMBasic's own sensor examples use,
because `STR2BIN()` then lifts the 16- and 32-bit fields straight out
of what was read.

Two rules the shared code enforces, both MMBasic's. A list must have
as many values as the count says, or you get `Argument count` — the
count is not a way to send fewer. And a destination is checked *before*
the transfer, so asking for forty bytes into an array of sixteen is
refused without the bus moving: a read addresses a device and can
advance a register pointer inside it, so it must not happen and then
fail.

Option bit 0 **holds** the bus: the transfer ends without a STOP so the
next one is a repeated START on the same device. Most register-file
devices do not need it — they keep their address pointer across a STOP —
but the ones that do would otherwise read plausible nonsense.

Two differences from a PicoMite, both deliberate:

* `timeout` is milliseconds, `0` or `100` and up as MMBasic requires,
  but **`0` means a five-second cap, not "no timeout"**. This kernel is
  non-preemptive: a transfer that waited for ever would not hang the
  program that asked for it, it would hang the machine, console and
  display included.
* A held bus that is never finished — the program errors, or is killed
  between the write and the read — is finished by the kernel, which
  clocks SCL until the device releases SDA and then issues a STOP.
  Nothing else on the board would free it.

The pins and the controller are claimed through the pin lock, so they
come back if the program dies, and a second program asking for the bus
gets a clear "already in use" rather than a collision.

### SPI — the first controller

```basic
SETPIN 2, 3, 4, SPI          ' any order: the pin decides its own role
SPI OPEN 62500000, 0, 8      ' speed, mode, bits
SPI WRITE 4, &H2A, 0, 0, 0   ' a list, an array a(), or a string
SPI READ 3, r$               ' into a string or a numeric array
v = SPI(&H55)                ' write one unit, read one back
PRINT MM.SPISPEED            ' the clock it ACTUALLY got
SPI CLOSE
```

**The order of the three pins does not matter.** The RP2350 decides
which signal each one carries: the controller is `(pin AND 8) = 0` for
SPI0, and the role is `pin AND 3` — 0 MISO, 1 CS, 2 SCLK, 3 MOSI. So
GP2/GP3/GP4 are SCLK/MOSI/MISO however you write them. On the header
SPI0 is **GP0–GP7 and GP34–GP39**; the rest (GP26, GP40, GP42–GP46) are
SPI1, which is **the SD card** and is not offered — a program that could
take it could take the filesystem out from under itself. This is
MMBasic's behaviour too: it asks each pin what it can be rather than
fixing an order.

**Chip select is yours**, exactly as on a PicoMite. A display needs CS
held across a whole command-and-data sequence rather than per transfer,
so only the program knows when to move it — and a pin is a register
write now, not a system call.

`MM.SPISPEED` is worth using. The divisor is `clk_peri / (CPSDVSR ×
(1 + SCR))` with `CPSDVSR` even, so a request nearly always lands on a
neighbouring value: asking for 50 MHz gives 46.875, and anything above
`clk_peri / 2` quietly becomes `clk_peri / 2`. The usable steps here
are 62.5, 46.875, 37.5, 31.25 MHz and down.

A whole transfer is **one system call whatever its length** — the
controller reads your buffer where it lies rather than copying it
through the kernel, which is sound here because there is no MMU and the
kernel cannot be preempted. A 240×320 screen of 16-bit pixels is
153,600 bytes and goes out in 26 ms at 62.5 MHz.

A string holds at most 255 bytes, so a 240-pixel row of RGB565 is 480
and will not fit in one. **A long string will**, and that is what the
extra word is for:

```basic
DIM INTEGER row(70)                ' 560 bytes of payload
' ... fill it with LONGSTRING APPEND ...
SPI WRITE 480, LONGSTRING row()    ' the whole row, one call
SPI READ  480, LONGSTRING row()    ' and back
```

**Say `LONGSTRING` and mean it**, because a long string *is* an integer
array: written `row()` it is a numeric array and sends one byte per
eight-byte cell, quietly and wrongly. That is MMBasic's behaviour, and
the extra word is how you say which of the two you meant.

It is not a speed feature. Filling 240×150 one call per row against
100 pixels a call measures 30 ms against 32 at 24 MHz, and 12 against
13 at 62.5 — the bus dominates. What changes is that the row can be
assembled at all, and with it a whole frame.

### One-wire and `TEMPR`

```basic
ONEWIRE RESET 26                   ' MM.ONEWIRE = 1 if something answered
ONEWIRE WRITE 26, 1, 1, &H33       ' reset first, then READ ROM
ONEWIRE READ  26, 0, 8, id()       ' the eight ROM bytes
PRINT TEMPR(26)                    ' a DS18B20, degrees C
```

Any header pin will do; the slots are timed in the program itself.
The flag is MMBasic's: **1** reset first, **2** reset afterwards, **4**
send or read single bits rather than bytes, **8** hold a strong pull-up
when finished, for a parasite-powered device.

The data and destination arguments are **the same ones `I2C2` and `SPI`
take** — a list, a string, a whole numeric array, a long string, or (on
a read) a list of variables one per byte. That is not a coincidence:
MMBasic reaches the same two functions from all three buses, and so
does this.

`TEMPR(pin)` starts a conversion and waits for it. `TEMPR START pin[,
precision[, timeout]]` starts one and returns immediately — 6 ms
measured — so the program can do something useful during the 750 ms a
12-bit conversion takes, and collect the reading later:

```basic
TEMPR START 26, 3                  ' 12 bits
' ... do something else ...
t = TEMPR(26)
```

**The wait sleeps rather than spins**, which is the one place this
differs from MMBasic on purpose. MMBasic has one program to run and
can afford to spin out three quarters of a second; this machine has
others. A `SETTICK` handler keeps firing throughout — eight ticks of a
100 ms timer during one 12-bit conversion, measured.

One honest limitation: a program here **cannot mask interrupts** the
way MMBasic does around a byte, and should not be able to. Nothing
takes the processor away mid-slot — the kernel cannot be preempted —
but a timer interrupt can still stretch one. One-wire tolerates a slot
being long rather than short, so a stretched write still reads
correctly; if a transfer matters, check the CRC the device gives you.

## Not covered

The editor, `RUN`, `LIST`, `EDIT` and the rest of the immediate-mode
environment, which will never apply: a translated program is compiled
and run rather than typed at a prompt. (`mmbedit` provides the editing
they existed for.) The remaining hardware statements are the subject
of current work.

Of the graphics, `MODE`, `COLOUR`, `PIXEL` (including the array form),
`LINE`, `CIRCLE`, `BOX`, `RBOX`, `TRIANGLE` (its drawing form —
`SAVE`/`RESTORE` need the interpreter's blit buffers), `ARC`, `RGB()`,
`FRAMEBUFFER` (including `LAYER` and `MERGE`), `PRINT @`, `TEXT`,
`FONT`, `CLS [colour]` and `MAP` (statement and function) are done, and
since v0.15 so are `BLIT` — including the flash slots it reads and
writes — and the `SPRITE` family with its two-axis `SCROLL`. The
picture loaders are all there: `SPRITE LOADARRAY`, `SPRITE LOADPNG`,
and `SPRITE LOADBMP` with `BLIT LOAD`/`LOADBMP` and their window
arguments, which cut one tile out of a sheet. `TEXT`
draws in any of MMBasic's nine built-in fonts, and in a font the
program defines for itself with `DefineFont` (numbers 10 to 16), but
in all five of MMBasic's orientations, the three that turn the
character itself included.

Of the pins, `SETPIN n, DIN|DOUT|AIN|ARAW|INTH|INTL|INTB|PWM|OFF`,
`PIN(n) =` and `PIN(n)` are done, and so are `PORT` in both directions
and `PULSE`. The counting inputs — `SETPIN n, FIN|CIN|PIN` — and the
pulse measurements `PULSIN(` and `DISTANCE(` are done as well, and all
five are **fixed on GP4–GP7**: they need the interrupt the kernel owns
on those four pins, and any other pin is refused by name rather than
measured badly. `WS2812` and `BITSTREAM` are done too, and those go the
other way — they are driven by PIO, so their pins are **GP0–GP7 and
GP26**. `PORT(pin, nbits [, pin, nbits]…)` reads or writes
several pins as one number, and **the first pin of a group is the
least significant bit** — `PORT(0,8) = 1` lights GP0, not GP7. Every
pin in a bank changes on the same clock edge, which is the whole
reason to use it rather than eight `PIN()` writes: written one at a
time, eight lines carry seven wrong values first, and anything clocked
off them sees all seven. A port spanning GP31/GP32 takes one store per
bank, as it must.

`PULSE pin, width` **inverts** the pin for the width rather than
driving it high, which is MMBasic's behaviour. Under 3 ms it blocks
and the width is exact; at 3 ms and above it returns at once and the
pin flips back later — at the next `PAUSE`, the next `PULSE`, or the
next statement in a program that also uses interrupts. MMBasic ends
the long ones from a hardware timer, and this machine has no
sub-second interval timer to hang one on.

`ONEWIRE RESET`, `WRITE` and `READ` are done, with `MM.ONEWIRE` and
MMBasic's four flag bits, and so are `TEMPR` and `TEMPR START` for a
DS18B20. `ONEWIRE SEARCH` is not — one device to a pin is what the
statements above assume.

Also `PWM slice, freq, duty [, duty2]`
with `PWM slice, OFF`, and `SERVO slice, position [, position2]` with
`SERVO slice, OFF`; the frequency and counting modes of `SETPIN`, and
`PWM SYNC`, are not. Interrupt handlers must be SUBs — MMBasic's label and
line-number targets are refused, and with them `IRETURN`, which a SUB
handler never needs.

Of the interrupts, `SETPIN INTH|INTL|INTB`, `SETTICK` (all four timers,
`PAUSE`, `RESUME`, off) and `ON KEY` (both forms) are done. They are
MMBasic's poll, checked between statements, with its priority order and
its no-nesting rule. **A `PAUSE` services them while it waits**, as
MMBasic's does — which matters because a program that arms a `SETTICK`
usually has a main loop of little else, so a `PAUSE` that ignored it
would mean the handler never ran at all. The wait is cut into slices
with the poll between them, and the slice is sized from the shortest
armed period: a slow tick still sleeps and costs nothing, a fast one
spins as MMBasic does, and only while the program is pausing.

Three divergences, all named where they are
described: `SETTICK` fires at the period asked for rather than MMBasic's
period-plus-a-millisecond; the console is checked at most every 5 ms;
and keys reach a program only when a line is complete, which is the tty
driver's doing and limits `ON KEY` to command-at-a-time input.
`ON PS2`, `INTERRUPT`, `PID` and `SENSORFUSION` have nothing to notify
on this machine. The analogue pair need an ADC pin (GP40–GP46 here), and `AIN` uses
MMBasic's own ten-sample sort-and-discard filter. `PIN()` returns a
float in every mode rather than MMBasic's integer for digital and
`ARAW`, and pins are *owned*: `SETPIN` claims from the kernel, only the
I/O header may be claimed, and the pin is released and reset when the
program ends however it ends. `OPTION VCC` is not supported, so `AIN`
always scales by 3.3 V.

Of the sound, `PLAY MP3`, `PLAY WAV`, `PLAY FLAC`, `PLAY VOLUME`,
`PLAY STOP`, `PLAY SOUND`, `PLAY TONE`, `PLAY MODFILE` and
`PLAY MODSAMPLE` are done — `MIDI`, `LOAD SOUND` and the user-defined
`U` waveform are not. `PLAY VOLUME` takes one level rather than one
per channel. All of them take the completion
interrupt MMBasic allows on them, though `PLAY STOP` reports about a
second late where MMBasic reports at once.

Of the statements that reach *into* something rather than replacing
it, `MID$(s$,n,m) =`, `LMID(a(),start[,num]) =`, `BIT(v,n) =`,
`BYTE(s$,n) =`, `FLAG(n) =` and `FLAGS =` are all done, with `BIT()`,
`BYTE()`, `FLAG()` and `MM.INFO(FLAGS)` reading them back. `FLAGS` is
sixty-four bits of scratch for the program's own use, cleared at
start — and one set *per program* here, where MMBasic has a single
firmware global. `LMID` is a **splice, not an overwrite**: `num` bytes
come out and the string goes in, so the long string grows or shrinks
unless the two lengths match, and leaving `num` out means "as long as
the replacement". Where MMBasic checks the target's type when the
statement runs, the translator knows an lvalue's type as it generates
the call, so a `BIT` on a string is refused at translation with the
line named.

`POS` gives the column the next character will go in, 1 at the start of
a line. `FLUSH #n` pushes a file out — `fflush` *and* `fsync`, since a
program that says `FLUSH` means the version that survives the power
going off. Note that this machine's `fsync` syncs the whole
filesystem, so it costs more than MMBasic's per-file version; channel
0 is the console and does nothing, as MMBasic's does.

In a graphics mode a program's `PRINT` now draws the characters into
whatever is being drawn on, as MMBasic does, so text goes into the
framebuffer with everything else. What is still missing is
`OPTION CONSOLE`, to say whether a program's output should go to the
screen, the serial port, or both.
