# Porting the MMBasic editor to Fuzix: a review

Question: can MMBasic's full-screen editor become a Fuzix file editor,
with BASIC syntax colouring, running as an ordinary task with the file
buffered in the PSRAM arena?

Answer: yes, and it is a much smaller job than the 9,076 lines of
Editor.c suggest.  Two things in the kernel console must be fixed
first, and there is one performance unknown worth measuring before
committing to the design.

## What the machine has today

`/bin` has `ed`, `vi`, `vile`, `levee` and `ue`.  What it does not have
is anything modern or WYSIWYG, and `ue` in particular mangled the
display - which turned out to be the console's wrap bug, not `ue`
(see STAGE 1 below).  None of them colour BASIC.

Relevant facts, all verified on the board:

- The tty has full termios: `icanon`, `echo` and `isig` can all be
  turned off, so raw-mode input works.
- The tty already reports **40 rows, 80 columns**, so the editor can
  take its geometry from `TIOCGWINSZ` rather than a compiled-in guess.
- A process gets `PROGSIZE` = 256K minus udata.
- The PSRAM arena gives 8 slots per process, 4K granular, as a **raw
  base address usable as a plain C pointer**.  It is not swapped, not
  context-switch copied, and released on exec and exit.

## What we are actually taking

Editor.c is 9,076 lines, but the file manager is more than half of it
and is out of scope ("file edit only"):

    lines      what                                    take?
    75-888     display plumbing + edit() entry points   yes    814
    889-6105   FILE MANAGER (fm_*)                      no   5,217
    6106-7411  FullScreenEditor - main loop, keys       yes  1,306
    7412-8302  MarkMode - block mark and clipboard      yes    891
    8303-8641  SetColour - syntax colouring             yes    339
    8642-9076  printLine/printScreen/insert/status      yes    435

**~3,785 lines to port**, and a good part of the 814 is MMBasic
display plumbing that gets replaced rather than translated.

Its dependencies on MMBasic internals are remarkably light - the whole
file references only:

    MMInkey 17   error 15   routinechecks 9   GetMemory 9
    ProgMemory 7   MMgetchar 4   ClearVars 4   tokenise 3
    commandtbl 3   SaveContext 2   RestoreContext 2   tokentbl 1

and of those, `ProgMemory`, `SaveContext`, `RestoreContext`,
`ClearVars`, `IfTableFree` and `SaveToProgMemory` exist purely to
support editing the in-memory program - which file-only editing does
not need.  What is left to provide is `MMInkey`, `MMgetchar`,
`GetMemory`, `error`, `routinechecks`, and the keyword tables.

## The big thing in our favour: the VT100 backend already exists

The editor was written with two output backends.  Alongside the
MMBasic display path (`MX470PutS`, `DrawBox`, tile colours) there is a
serial-terminal path: `PrintString`/`SSputchar` are function pointers
that default to `SerialConsolePutC`, and the colouring function is
literally `SetColour(unsigned char *p, int DoVT100)`.

The sequences it emits are ordinary ANSI:

    SGR 30-37, 40-47, 0, 7, 4      colours, inverse, underline
    CSI K, CSI J, CSI 2J CSI H     erase line / display / home
    CSI ?25 l/h                    cursor hide/show
    ESC 7 / ESC 8                  save/restore cursor
    CSI ?7 l/h                     autowrap off/on
    CSI ?1000 l/h                  mouse reporting

Our console.c implements a VT100/CSI subset already, and it covers
almost all of that: SGR 0,1,7,22,27,30-37,39,40-47,49,90-97,100-107,
ESC 7/8, CSI A-H, J, K, m, s, u, ?25 l/h.  Mouse reporting we neither
have nor want, and unknown sequences are parsed and swallowed rather
than printed, so it does no harm.  SGR 4 (underline) is accepted but
not rendered - cosmetic.

**We do not have to write a renderer.**  That is the single reason
this port is a few weeks rather than a rewrite.

## THE EDITOR RUNS (commit bb34b41fd) - what is left

Everything on the previous ordered list is done and verified on the
board.  `mmbedit <file>` opens, colours, edits, saves with a `.bak` and
exits; `mmbc`/`cc`/run on the file it just saved works, so the machine
now edits, translates, compiles and runs its own BASIC.

**F4 AND F12 ARE DONE** (commit 1102335ad) - mark mode and the
beautifier are ported and tested on the board, so the editor is now
feature-complete against MMBasic's bar the file manager.  What follows
is kept as the record of how they were ported; the remaining work is
the numbered list after it.

Fast loop worth reusing for any further editor work: the editor builds
and runs on Linux unchanged, so an ASan build of
`mmbedit.c shim.c editor.c keywords.c` driven through a pty finds a
fault in seconds without touching the board.

Mark mode was also the first code to exercise
restoreColourFromLineStart: un-highlighting has to restore the syntax
colour for a character mid-line, which replays the colour state machine
from the start of that line.  It had been ported with SetColour and had
never run.

WHAT WAS PORTED: mark mode (Editor.c 7402-8208) and the beautifier
(5536-6105), the same way as the rest - take the region verbatim,
delete the mouse and tile blocks, let mmb_compat.h supply the names.
Two things needed adapting: the ESC handler no longer peeks for a
TeraTerm mouse report, because inkey() reassembles escape sequences
itself and peeking would eat the next keystroke; and F10 export writes
with open/write rather than MMBasic's file layer.

STILL TO DO on the editor, in whatever order suits:

1. **A soak from the USB keyboard.**  Everything so far was driven down
   the serial console with devtools/fzkeys.py.
2. **The file manager**, if it is ever wanted - 5,217 lines, and out of
   scope from the start.

The graphics work moved on from here; see PC3-GFX-DESIGN.md and the
project memory for the batched drawing architecture and what is next.

**Before touching the editor again, know that the "editor lockup" was
not the editor.** It was `switchin` returning to a resumed process with
PRIMASK still set (commit 7d4f38058), which wedged the console on any
sustained output - `cat` of a 70K file did it just as well.  If output
ever stops dead again, `rawuart_ready` prints the uart's own state to
the screen after two million not-ready returns; that diagnostic is
still in the tree and it is what found this.

**Known rough edges**, none blocking:

- the status line only refreshes on an edit or after five seconds of
  idling; MMBasic refreshed it far more often because its poll loop
  spun rather than blocking for 100ms.
- the function-key legend is drawn on the first keystroke rather than
  on entry.  That is MMBasic's own behaviour (`drawstatusline` is set
  before the loop and acted on inside it), kept deliberately.
- a file over 120K is refused rather than paged.  The buffer is a flat
  array in the process's own SRAM - see the memory section below for
  why that beat the PSRAM arena.

## STAGE 1 IS DONE (commit 41d7ee07b)

Both blockers below are fixed and measured on hardware.  `wraptest`
(utils/wraptest.c) asks the console where the cursor actually is with
CSI 6n, so the result does not depend on anyone looking at the screen.

Against the old kernel, 4 of 7 failed - including the one that matters
most, writing the bottom right cell scrolling the whole screen:

    after writing col 80, cursor stays    (2,1)  want (1,80)  FAIL
    DECAWM off: no wrap, stays on col 80  (7,2)  want (6,80)  FAIL
    DECAWM back on: defers again          (9,1)  want (8,80)  FAIL
    bottom-right cell does not scroll     (40,1) want (40,80) FAIL

Against the new kernel all seven pass.  The rest of this section is
kept as the record of what was wrong and why.

## Blocker 1: the console always wraps

`charout()` in console.c wraps unconditionally the moment the 80th
column is written:

    if (++cx >= CON_COLS) { cx = 0; cy++; }

There is no DECAWM, and no deferred wrap.  A full-screen editor cannot
live with this: painting the last column of any row moves the cursor
to the next line, and painting the bottom-right cell scrolls the
entire screen.  The editor sends `CSI ?7 l` precisely to prevent it,
and console.c swallows it.

Two pieces of work, both in console.c:

1. Implement `CSI ?7 h/l` and honour it.
2. Implement the **deferred wrap** VT100 actually specifies: writing
   the last column leaves the cursor *on* that column with a pending
   flag; the wrap happens when the next printable character arrives.
   This is worth doing regardless of the editor - it is why a
   full-width line renders correctly on a real terminal, and any
   full-screen program we ever run will assume it.

This is the one change that must land in the kernel, and it is small
and independently testable.

## Blocker 2: the function keys were not VT100

The editor is driven from the function keys - F1 save-and-exit, F2
save-exit-and-run, F3 find, F5, F10, and so on, plus SHIFT-F3 for
find-again.  All twelve appear in the key dispatch.

The keyboard was **inconsistent with itself**.  `kbd_decode.c` emits
proper VT100 for arrows, Home, End, Insert, Delete, PgUp and PgDn, but
F1-F12 fell through to the layout tables, which carry MMBasic's
pseudo-ASCII codes (0x91-0x9c, shifted 0xb1-0xbc) because they were
imported from MMBasic wholesale.  So F1 pushed a bare 0x91 while the
up arrow pushed `ESC [ A`.

Fixed by emitting what a terminal emits - SS3 P..S for F1-F4,
`CSI 15/17..24 ~` for F5-F12 (16 and 22 skipped, as on a VT220), and
xterm's modifier form when shifted.  The deciding argument is that one
`pc3` termcap entry has to describe both this keyboard and a serial
terminal on the same tty, and the editor must work over the serial
console - TeraTerm cannot send 0x91.  A program wanting MMBasic's
codes maps them back in its own `inkey()`, which the editor has to do
for the serial case anyway.

termcap gained `xn` (the magic-margin flag, which now describes us
honestly), `k1`-`k12`, and the editing cluster - so `vi`, `levee` and
`ue` get function keys as a side effect.

## The shim we have to write

Small, and the only genuinely new code:

- **`inkey()`** - read raw bytes and reassemble CSI/SS3 sequences back
  into the editor's single key codes (`F1`, `UP`, `PUP`, ...).  This
  is the inverse of what kbd_decode.c does, and both ends must agree.
  ~150 lines.
- **raw mode** - `tcsetattr` with `icanon`, `echo` and `isig` off,
  restored on exit and on signal.  The editor must not be killable
  into a wedged terminal.
- **`GetMemory()`** -> a static buffer (see the memory section; the
  arena turned out not to be needed).
- **`error()`** -> print and return to the shell.
- **`routinechecks()`** -> no-op, or a signal check.
- file load/save, and `main()` in place of `cmd_editfile()`.

## Memory: where the file buffer lives

The editor keeps the whole file in one contiguous buffer and memmoves
the tail on every insert and delete.  The obvious home was the PSRAM
arena - a single allocation, a raw pointer, megabytes available.  Two
measurements moved it back into the process's own SRAM; both are
below.

### MEASURED (psbench, on the board)

    PSRAM  memmove(p+1, p, n)   12 MB/s   (any size, any alignment)
    PSRAM  memmove(p+4096, p, n) 12 MB/s
    SRAM   memmove(p+1, p, n)   44 MB/s
    sustained: 200 inserts x 64K tail = 1066 ms, 5330 us each

PSRAM is 3.7x slower than SRAM, and the editor's awkward case - an
overlapping backward move at a one-byte offset - costs no more than an
aligned one, so there is no fast path being missed.  Cost of one
keystroke, which is one memmove of everything after the cursor:

    tail     16K    32K    64K    128K    256K    512K
    PSRAM   1.3ms  2.5ms  5.4ms  10.7ms  21.5ms  42.9ms

**Second constraint, and it is the binding one: the arena is 1024 KB
in total** ("PSRAM disc 7104KiB (arena 1024KiB)"), and cc2 wants it too
for ARENA_TABLES.  A megabyte edit buffer would take the whole thing.

### ...but the buffer does not need PSRAM at all

`memprobe` carried a real 120 KB static buffer, touched and verified
every page, and then grew the break until the kernel refused:

    static buffer: 120 KB, intact
    sbrk headroom above that: 120 KB
    so an editor could have 240 KB of buffer in its own space
    free: total 320, used 68, free 252

**A process gets ~240 KB of its own SRAM** (PROGSIZE is 256 KB less
udata).  Allow ~60 KB for the ported editor's code and ~16 KB of stack
and roughly 170 KB is left for a buffer - so the 120 KB that covers
nearly everything in MMBasic fits with room to spare.

### DECISION: flat buffer, 120 KB, in the process's own SRAM

No arena, no ioctl, no PSRAM.  Five reasons, and the first is just
arithmetic:

1. **SRAM is 3.7x faster.**  A worst-case keystroke against a full
   120 KB buffer is 2.7 ms, against 10.7 ms for the same thing in
   PSRAM.  Holding a key down stops being a question.
2. cc2 keeps the whole 1024 KB arena; the editor and the compiler no
   longer compete for it.
3. It is **exactly MMBasic's own architecture** - a static buffer -
   so it is one less deviation from the reference in a 3,785-line
   port.
4. It is swap-safe by construction.  The arena is explicitly NOT
   swapped, which would have been a subtle hazard for a long-lived
   interactive process.
5. The whole editor process is then ~190 KB, so it and a shell live
   inside the 320 KB process area at once and nothing swaps.  (240 KB
   of buffer would also fit, but leaves less headroom for whatever
   else is running.)

MMBasic's own editor buffer is ~96 KB, so at 120 KB we are running the
reference implementation slightly above the size it was designed for,
on a machine that is faster at moving the bytes.

The gap buffer is now firmly off the table: it was only ever needed to
paper over PSRAM's bandwidth.

### The old PSRAM-based decision, kept for the record

Worst case - typing at the very top of a full 128 KB file - is 10.7 ms
per keystroke, and the typical case (cursor mid-file) is half that.
Usable.  128 KB is about 4,000 lines of BASIC, larger than the solar
eclipse, and comfortably more than MMBasic's own 96 KB editor buffer,
so we are running the reference implementation inside the size it was
designed for.

The decisive argument is not the milliseconds, it is that a flat
buffer means **MMBasic's editor code is used unmodified**.  In a
3,785-line port every deviation is a bug I would have to find on
hardware.  A gap buffer - free space parked at the cursor, so ordinary
typing moves nothing - is the textbook answer and would make file size
a non-issue, but it breaks the assumption that the buffer is flat, and
that assumption is threaded through findLine, printLine, SetColour and
the mark/clipboard code.

So: flat now, and if it proves sticky in real use, add the gap buffer
knowing it is needed rather than guessing.  Holding a key down is the
case to watch - auto-repeat at 30/s against a 64 KB tail is 5.3 ms per
repeat, which is 16% of the CPU doing nothing but memmove.

## Syntax colouring: a decision to make

`SetColour` recognises keywords by looking them up in MMBasic's
`commandtbl` and `tokentbl`, plus three of its own lists
(`twokeywordtbl`, `specialkeywords`, `hiddenfunctions`).  A standalone
editor has none of those tables, so we must supply a keyword list.
Two options, and they give genuinely different products:

1. **Every MMBasic keyword.**  Extract the command and token names
   from MMBasic's headers into a static table - a few hundred strings,
   generated, not hand-typed.  Faithful to MMBasic, and the right
   answer if the editor is for writing MMBasic generally.
2. **Only what `mmbc` supports.**  We already generate exactly this
   list for Appendix C of the manual, from mmb2c's own dispatch and
   builtin tables (59 statements, 69 functions, `fcc/coverage.py`).
   Colouring only the supported set turns the editor into live
   feedback on what will actually translate - type `SPRITE` and it
   stays white.

**DECIDED: three colours.**  A keyword that is real MMBasic but not
supported by mmbc gets its own colour - distinct from both a supported
keyword and from ordinary text.  That makes the editor live feedback
on translator coverage without ever lying about what is valid MMBasic.
The table therefore needs a flag per entry, not two separate lists:
generate it from MMBasic's command/token names with the mmbc-supported
set (fcc/coverage.py) marking the flag.

## Proposed staging

1. **DONE** - Kernel console: deferred wrap + DECAWM, F1-F12 in
   kbd_decode.c, termcap.  `wraptest` passes 7/7 on hardware.
2. **DONE** - PSRAM measured at 12 MB/s (psbench).  Flat buffer,
   capped at 128 KB; gap buffer only if it proves sticky in use.
3. **The shim**: raw mode, `inkey()`, arena allocation, file I/O,
   stubs.  Get a stub editor that paints a file and moves the cursor.
4. **Import the editor core** with the file-manager and
   program-memory paths removed and the VT100 backend forced on.
5. **Colouring**: the keyword table, per the decision above.
6. **Test**, and add it to the manual.

Stage 1 is worth doing whatever happens to the rest - it is a real
defect in the console today.

## Licensing

Editor.c carries MMBasic's BSD-style header and you are one of the
copyright holders, so this is your call rather than a question.  Worth
recording only because it lives in our fork: FUZIX upstream takes no
AI-generated code, so this is not an upstreaming candidate in any
case.
