# FRAMEBUFFER LAYER and FRAMEBUFFER MERGE

**BUILT, 2026-08-12.** The decision below was taken first and the
implementation followed it exactly: `disp_fb3` beside `disp_fb2`,
`display_fb_merge` in display.c, `GFXIOC_MERGE`, a third target for
`display_fb_select`, and `FRAMEBUFFER LAYER` / `WRITE L` / `COPY` with
L at either end / `MERGE [c]` / `CLOSE L` through the runtime and both
translators.

Three things the sketch did not foresee, all found on the board:

**The depth is not always four bits.** MMBasic has two modes here and
they are different shapes: MODE 1 is the 640×480 **one-bit** console,
MODE 2 is 320×240 in 16 colours. MMBasic's `merge_scanline` keys per
nibble, and transcribing it unconditionally meant MODE 1 treated eight
pixels as two four-bit numbers — which still drew a picture and
reported plausible timings. The merge branches on depth now, and 1bpp
is the *cheap* case: a pixel is a bit, so transparent 0 is an `OR` and
transparent 1 an `AND`, 32 pixels a word.

**It reads two PSRAM buffers, so it must not read them together.** The
obvious loop takes a byte of F and a byte of L per output byte: two
streams 38,400 bytes apart competing for one XIP cache, each evicting
the other. It is two passes instead — `memcpy` F down as one linear
stream, then stream L once with the destination reads coming from SRAM.
For the same reason `display_fb_merge` is one of the few things
deliberately kept OUT of flash: its instruction fetches would contend
with its own data.

**Adding two flag bytes overflowed the kernel's RAM by eight bytes and
would not link.** The state is packed into one byte now. That is the
40K argument below, met from the other side and rather more sharply
than expected.

Measured, MODE 2: **16.62 ms a frame** for draw-plus-merge — 60 fps
exactly, the loop quantised by the blanking wait. `COPY F,N`, which is
pass one of a merge, is 0.75 ms for 38,400 bytes. The composite alone
cannot be timed while the wait is unconditional, and the wait is
unconditional because a merge writes into the buffer being scanned out:
starting part way down the screen tears, once per merge.

The reasoning that led here follows, unchanged.

## What MMBasic does, twice

MMBasic implements transparent overlays **two different ways**, in two
different builds, and the difference is where the compositing happens.

### LAYER — in the display driver (VGA and HDMI builds)

`graphics/HDMI.c`, inside the scanline builder. There are three
buffers, tested per pixel in order:

```c
l = LayerBuf[pp + i];
d = DisplayBuf[pp + i];
s = SecondLayer[pp + i];
if ((s & 0xf) != transparents)      *p++ = map16quads[s & 0xf];
else if ((l & 0xf) != transparent)  *p++ = map16quads[l & 0xf];
else                                *p++ = map16quads[d & 0xf];
```

`SecondLayer` wins, else `LayerBuf`, else `DisplayBuf`; each overlay
has its own transparent index (`transparents`, `transparent`). Nothing
is ever copied — the composite is recomputed for every pixel of every
frame, continuously, for free as far as the program is concerned.

`FRAMEBUFFER LAYER` (`FrameBuffer.c`) just allocates it:

```c
LayerBuf = GetMemory(HRes * VRes / 2);
```

The cost is that **every buffer must be readable at scanout rate**.

### MERGE — in the application (TFT builds: ILI9341 and friends)

`FrameBuffer.c`, `merge()` and `merge_scanline()`. Two off-screen
buffers are combined into the physical display when the command is
issued:

```c
uint8_t top = src_pixel & 0xF0, bottom = src_pixel & 0x0F;
if (top == highcolour && bottom == colour) continue;   /* whole byte clear */
uint8_t new_top    = (top    != highcolour) ? top    : (dst[x] & 0xF0);
uint8_t new_bottom = (bottom != colour)     ? bottom : (dst[x] & 0x0F);
dst[x] = new_top | new_bottom;
```

Keyed per **nibble** on packed 4bpp bytes, with an early-out when a
whole byte is transparent. Eight scanlines are accumulated in a stack
buffer and pushed to the panel in one call. `FRAMEBUFFER MERGE
[colour]` takes the transparent index, 0 to 15, defaulting to 0.

Because it runs once on demand, the source buffers can live anywhere.

## Why this port cannot simply take the driver version

Three reasons, in order of weight.

**1. There is no SRAM for it.** `DISP_FB_POOL` is 40,960 bytes. A
driver-side layer has to be in SRAM, because core1 DMAs the scanout
from it line by line. The kernel has ~8.6K of RAM free, so the layer
would come off the 340K process pool, leaving about 300K — **12% of
every program's memory, permanently, for a feature most programs never
use.** It cannot be made conditional either: the pool is carved at link
time by `linker_overrides/memory_ram.incl` and `TOTALMEM`, long before
any program says `FRAMEBUFFER LAYER`.

**2. It would slow the one path that must never be late.** The
`EXP_4BPP_X2` expander's inner loop is a single 32-bit load from
`gfx_lut[byte]` and a single store, covering two pixels at once:

```c
*(uint32_t *)p = *(const uint32_t *)gfx_lut[s[t]];
```

Transparent keying is per nibble, so that byte-wide lookup stops
working in the general case. MMBasic's own early-out — one compare for
"both nibbles transparent" — would keep an *empty* layer nearly free,
and is the right mitigation if this is ever built. But it is still
extra work per byte on core1's deadline, and a miss there is a visible
glitch, not a slow frame.

**3. The port already made this decision once.** From the comment on
`disp_fb2` in `display.c`:

> Drawing into PSRAM is a QMI transaction through a write-back XIP
> cache, so it is slower than SRAM - which is exactly why MMBasic's
> model is draw-then-COPY rather than scanning out from the layer.
> Scanout must stay on disp_fb: core1 DMAs from it line by line.

The `F` buffer is in PSRAM precisely because core1 cannot read it. A
layer is the same object with the same constraint.

## The decision

**Implement the MERGE model. Use `FRAMEBUFFER LAYER` as the command
that creates the second off-screen buffer, and `FRAMEBUFFER MERGE` as
the composite.**

This is not a compromise invented for this port — **it is the other
MMBasic build**. A program written for a PicoMite driving an ILI9341
runs unchanged. Only the *moment* of compositing differs, and MMBasic
itself defines both moments.

It also fits what is already here: `COPY F,N` is a 38,400-byte
PSRAM->SRAM copy measured at **0.726 ms** (53 MB/s bulk, not the 12
MB/s that scattered access suggests). A merge reads two PSRAM buffers
instead of one and composites on the way, so 2-3 ms against a 16.7 ms
frame is the expectation — **to be measured, not assumed.** The last
prediction about PSRAM here was out by 4.4x, in our favour, which is
the reason for saying so.

## Sketch, if it is built

* a second PSRAM buffer beside `disp_fb2` — another 40K of PSRAM and
  of swap, irrelevant against 8 MB
* a merge routine in `display.c`, taking the transparent index;
  MMBasic's per-nibble rule and its whole-byte early-out, copied
* `GFXIOC_MERGE` carrying the transparent colour
* `display_fb_select` learning a third target (N, F, L)
* `FRAMEBUFFER LAYER` / `WRITE L` / `MERGE [c]` / `CLOSE L` through the
  runtime, `mmb2c.py` and the `mmbc` mirror, byte-identical

Comparable in size to the original FRAMEBUFFER work.

## What would justify revisiting the driver version

**A mouse pointer.** `graphics/Pointer.c` is a caller of this
machinery in MMBasic, and a cursor over graphics is the one case where
compositing genuinely has to be continuous: you cannot merge the whole
screen on every mouse movement. If pointer support is ever wanted,
that is the moment to spend the 40K deliberately and to measure the
expander with the whole-byte early-out in place - rather than now, on
speculation.

Note also that MMBasic's HDMI build supports *two* overlays. Nothing
here needs a second one, and it would double the cost.
