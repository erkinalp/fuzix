 * There is NO on-board flash filesystem, and the absence is worth as

 *
 * It was a dhara FTL over the XIP flash, mounted /dev/hda, and it was
 * never a release asset: root has always been the SD card and swap is
 * a PSRAM allocation.  What it cost was out of all proportion to that:
 *
 *  - 7,912 bytes of SRAM, measured.  dhara's journal and map, devflash,
 *    rawflash and the SDK's hardware_flash all had to be RAM-RESIDENT,
 *    because code cannot execute from a device it is erasing.  That is
 *    two 4K blocks of the process pool.
 *
 *  - a standing rule over every future placement decision.  "Must not
 *    be reached while the flash is busy" is the constraint that made
 *    linker_overrides/ dangerous to edit, and it existed only for this.
 *
 *  - four numbers that had to agree - FLASH_OFFSET, the Makefile's uf2
 *    offset, mkftl's -s, and PICO_FLASH_SIZE_BYTES - where a stale one
 *    wrote the disk over the kernel image.  That had already bricked a
 *    board once.
 *
 * So the SD card is now hda and the PSRAM swap disc is hdb.  The boot
 * prompt wants "hda2" where it used to want "hdb2".  Nothing else in
 * the system moved: rc has had no swapon since swap stopped being a
 * device, which was the other half of the old argument for keeping it.

 * The udata block: struct u_data at the bottom, the kernel stack
 * growing down onto it from the top, and PROGLOAD immediately above.
 * 3 blocks (1.5K) was the figure for a system whose deepest kernel
 * call was a filesystem one.
 *
 * TLS changed that.  mbedtls runs inside the network pump, which is
 * reached from plt_idle - so it is NESTED on top of whichever syscall
 * just went to sleep, on that process's kernel stack.  A handshake
 * took a 1.5K stack down through udata and 176 bytes out of the bottom
 * of progbase (sp=0x2002bf50 against a progbase of 0x2002c000), which
 * corrupted the process table and killed the machine.
 *
 * MEASURED, not guessed: net_cyw43.c painted the region and watched it
 * during a real handshake to example.com.  Peak 2,460 bytes.  That is
 * also exactly consistent with the crash - sp reached 1,712 bytes down
 * a stack that only had 1,156 usable - and it is far less than the 6.5K
 * and 16K that two earlier guesses spent.
 *
 * 12 blocks is 6,144, less struct u_data's 328 = 5,816 of stack: 2.4x
 * the measured peak.  The margin is there because certificate
 * VERIFICATION has not been measured - the handshake above had no CA
 * bundle loaded, and chain walking is the deeper path.  net_cyw43.c
 * keeps a canary just above udata that says so if this is ever wrong.
 *
 * The cost is per RESIDENT PROCESS: udata lives inside the process
 * image, so every resident process pays the extra 4,608 bytes, which is
 * one more 4K pool block each.  That is what buys TLS.
 *
 * UDATA_SIZE_ASM in cpu-armm0/kernel-armm0.def must match; main.c
