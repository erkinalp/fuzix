/*
 * Raspberry Pi Pico GPIO.
 *
 * The RP2350B on this board has FORTY-EIGHT GPIOs, not the 28 of an
 * RP2040 - and it matters: the PC3 puts the DS3231 alarm on GP32, which
 * the old limit made unreachable.
 *
 * The interface here is PER PIN (struct gpioreq: pin, val) rather than
 * upstream's byte-and-group model (struct gpio, GPIOC_SETBYTE).  Forty
 * eight pins do not divide into meaningful 8-bit ports on this part,
 * and every user of them here - a BASIC SETPIN, an LED, an LCD strobe -
 * addresses one pin at a time.
 *
 * NO LOCKING, deliberately.  Two things make it unnecessary:
 *
 *   - the kernel is non-preemptive, so an ioctl that does not sleep is
 *     atomic against every other process, and none of these sleep;
 *   - gpio_put(), gpio_set_dir() and gpio_init() reach the hardware
 *     through the RP2350's ATOMIC set/clear/OE registers and a per-pin
 *     function-select, so there is no read-modify-write for an
 *     interrupt or core1 to land in the middle of.
 *
 * Two processes driving two pins therefore cannot corrupt each other,
 * and two driving ONE pin get last-writer-wins - nonsense, but not
 * damage.  Measured with utils/gpiotog.c on GP2 and GP3.
