"""Drive the PC3 through a demonstration, at a pace a camera can follow.

  python demo.py                    the whole thing, from the login: prompt
  python demo.py --list             the scenes, and how long each one takes
  python demo.py --scene graphics   one scene, for rehearsing a single part
  python demo.py --from eclipse     pick up part way through
  python demo.py --fast             rehearsal speed: no reading pauses
  python demo.py --no-down          stop before the shutdown scene

The consoles are MIRRORED - one tty1 goes to both the HDMI display and
the serial line, and input is merged - so everything typed down the
serial port appears on the screen the camera is pointed at, as though a
hand were typing it.  That is the whole trick: this types, the video
records the screen, and nobody has to type accurately on camera.

Two settings do the pacing.  DEMO_CPM is the typing speed in characters
per minute and defaults to 150 - an ordinary hand at a keyboard, which
is what it has to look like.  DEMO_READ scales the pauses between steps,
which are what make a video watchable and the first thing to raise if it
feels rushed.  For a rehearsal, DEMO_CPM=2000 with --fast checks that
every command WORKS without also taking the full running time.

A step ends when the board has been quiet for `settle` seconds.  A
program that goes quiet WHILE IT WORKS needs a longer one: the compiler
prints a dot per function and is fine, but bench.bas computes silently
for 30 seconds a round and would have its output cut off - which is why
it is not in here.  Nothing in these scenes is silent for long.

Requires pyserial, and runs on the Windows side because the CH340 is a
COM port.  Set FZPORT if it is not COM14.
