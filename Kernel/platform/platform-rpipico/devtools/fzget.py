"""Fetch a TEXT file off the board, over the console.

uusend.py goes one way only, and everything written on the board - a
program typed in mmbedit, a test someone wrote there - was stranded: the
card is the only copy, and re-imaging the card destroys it.

  python fzget.py /root/cc/brownian.bas [local]

Text only, and deliberately: `cat` between two markers needs nothing on
the board that is not already there.  Binaries would need uuencode,
which the board does not have (uusend relies on `uud`, the other
direction).

CR is dropped: the console is a tty and turns every LF into CRLF on the
way out, which would otherwise double up on a file that already has
them.
