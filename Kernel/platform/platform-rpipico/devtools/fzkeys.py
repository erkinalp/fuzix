"""Drive a full-screen program on the board and show what it painted.

fzsh.py reads to a shell prompt, which a program that owns the screen
never gives it.  This one takes a command and then a script of key
groups, waiting between them, and prints the output with the escape
sequences made visible - so an editor session can be checked from here
without anyone looking at the monitor.

  python fzkeys.py "mmbedit /root/t.bas" "\\x1bOP" "\\x1b"

Keys use Python escapes: \\x1b for ESC, \\r for Return, \\x1bOP for F1.

# QUIET GAP, and why it is this long.
# 
# Typing into a console that is still streaming is a known way to lock
# the PC3 up - it is why fzsh.py reads to a prompt and uusend.py
# refuses to start unless the line is idle.  A full screen repaint here
# is several kilobytes AND the editor stops to compute syntax colours
# between lines, so it goes quiet for a long time mid-paint while being
# nowhere near finished.  A short gap reads that pause as "done" and
# sends the next key into the middle of the stream.
# 
# 3 seconds is well past anything the editor pauses for.  If a test
# ever looks like it hung, raise this before suspecting the board.
