MMBasic examples for the Pico Computer 3
========================================

Each of these is a working MMBasic program.  To run one:

    mmbc pixart.bas -o pixart.c     translate it to C
    cc pixart.c -o pixart.bc        compile that
    bcrun pixart.bc                 run it

The .bc keeps its "#!" line, so once built it also runs as ./pixart.bc
on its own.  A big program takes a while in cc - eclipse and picofrog
are minutes, not seconds.

Most of them draw on the screen rather than printing, so watch the
display and not the serial console.  A few want hardware plugged in
and say so below; they fail politely if it is not there.

Where to start
--------------
  t1.bas        if you want the language
  pixart.bas    if you want the screen
  playdemo.bas  if you want noise
  picofrog.bas  if you want to play something

picofrog is a port of Martin Herhaus's PicoMite game; the header of
the file lists every change the port made and why.

robots.bas is PETSCII Robots - the largest MMBasic program here, and
the only one with data of its own.  It lives in robots/ together with
its levels, music, pictures and sprite library, and must be run FROM
THAT DIRECTORY, because it looks for them relative to wherever it is
started:

    cd /root/MMBasic/robots
    mmbc robots.bas
    cc robots.c
    ./robots.bc

chess/ is TSCP - Tom Kerrigan's chess engine, converted to MMBasic by
Ceptimus - with its pieces and its opening book.  Run it from its own
directory too, and type `help` at the tscp> prompt:

    cd /root/MMBasic/chess
    cc chess.bas
    ./chess.bc

It is also the port's own demonstration of the sprite loaders: the
pieces are cut out of one 240x20 BMP with SPRITE LOADBMP's window form,
and mkspr.bas there turns that sheet into the .spr file SPRITE LOAD
reads, on the machine itself.  See chess/README.md.

retic/ is a whole product: Geoff Graham's WebMite reticulation
(sprinkler) controller, ported - a web server you configure from a
browser at this machine's address on port 80.  Its MIGRATION.md
lists every change the port made and why.  Like robots it must be
run from its own directory (the web pages live beside it):

    cd /root/MMBasic/retic
    mmbc retic.bas -o retic.c
    cc -o retic retic.c
    ./retic

It takes a few minutes to compile.  Play it with the arrow keys and
space, or with a switch array on GP34-GP41 (the Game*Mite layout).
