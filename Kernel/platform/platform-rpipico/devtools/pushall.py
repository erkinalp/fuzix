"""Push everything that has to move together when BASIC support changes.

  python pushall.py            # build nothing, send what is already built
  python pushall.py --headers  # only the cc headers

Add a statement, or change mmb_runtime.c/.h or the mmb_gfx*.h set, and
these things on the board are involved:

    /usr/lib/cc/include/mmb_*.h         every header the on-board cc
                                        reads - one per primitive or
                                        family, taken by glob from
                                        Applications/mmb2c
    /usr/bin/bcrun                      the runtime is compiled INTO it
    /usr/bin/mmbc                       the translator
    /usr/bin/mmbedit                     its keyword colouring

Miss one and it fails at RUN time, not build time, because the on-board
cc allows implicit declarations: a call to a function a stale header no
longer declares still compiles, and comes out with the WRONG ARGUMENT
WIDTHS.  That cost an afternoon once - mm_map's index arrived as
(colour << 32) | index and the error blamed the index.

Build first, from the FUZIX tree:

    make -f Makefile.armm0 FUZIX_ROOT=... USERCPU=armm0 bcrun mmbc
    (cd ../../../Applications/mmbedit && make -f Makefile.armm0 ...)

then run this.  Everything is stripped on the way.
