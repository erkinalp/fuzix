"""Send a binary to the PC3 over the console as uuencoded text.

  python uusend.py <localfile> <remotename> [gap_ms]

gap_ms is ACCEPTED AND IGNORED if it is below the 25 ms default, and it
is the only argument here that ever mattered: three separate board
crashes - gap 0 twice, then gap 5 - each wedged the console mid-transfer
and cost a full fsck. The tty queue is 132 bytes and the per-line gap is
what keeps at most one line outstanding; below the default that stops
being true, intermittently, which is worse than failing outright. A
LARGER value is honoured, because more time between lines is only ever
safer.

Avoids XMODEM entirely. rx/sx assume a serial port separate from the
console -- they poll the console for a keypress to cancel, so on a
machine where the console *is* the link the first byte of the transfer
reads as "cancel". Sending printable text through the line discipline
has no such problem, and needs no second UART.

Writes the text with "cat > name.uu", then runs "uud" on the board.
Lines are 62 characters, well inside the 132-byte tty queue, with a
gap after each so cat can drain it.
