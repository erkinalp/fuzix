 * show shape: selecting it points the DRAWING primitives at it, scanout
 * is unaffected and always reads disp_fb, so the picture appears only on
 * the copy.
 *
 * Which buffer the primitives write to is a property of the CALLING
 * PROCESS, not of the machine: one process owns the layer at a time
 * (display_fb_open), and every graphics ioctl re-points the primitives
 * for whoever is making it (display_fb_enter). Without that, a program
 * that selected the layer and then blocked would have the next process
 * to draw - or the shell, or a repaint - land in its picture, and a
 * program that exited without deselecting would leave the machine
 * drawing off-screen with no way back.

 * And a THIRD buffer, the LAYER - MMBasic's FRAMEBUFFER LAYER.
 *
 * It is another off-screen framebuffer and nothing more; what makes it
 * a layer is MERGE, which composites it OVER the F buffer and puts the
 * result on the screen, skipping whichever colour index is nominated
 * transparent.  Neither source is changed.
 *
 * MMBasic implements overlays two ways.  Its VGA and HDMI builds test
 * three buffers per pixel inside the scanline builder, so the composite
 * is continuous and free; its TFT builds composite on demand in merge()
 * (FrameBuffer.c:844).  THIS PORT TAKES THE TFT MODEL, deliberately -
 * a scanout-time layer would have to live in SRAM for core1 to DMA it,
 * which is 40K off every process's 340K pool forever, for a feature
 * most programs never use.  PC3-LAYER-MERGE.md has the whole argument
 * and what would justify revisiting it (a mouse pointer).
 *
 * A program written for a PicoMite driving an ILI9341 therefore runs
 * unchanged; only the moment of compositing differs, and MMBasic itself
 * defines both moments.
