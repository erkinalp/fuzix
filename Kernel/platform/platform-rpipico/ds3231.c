 * DS3231 real-time clock on the Pico Computer 3 (I2C0, GP20=SDA/GP21=SCL,

 * at boot: setdate (run from rc) reads /dev/rtc and calls stime() without
 * prompting; `setdate -w` writes system time back to the chip.
 *
 * /dev/rtc traffic uses struct cmos_rtc in CMOS_RTC_DEC form: year as two
 * little-endian bytes (AD), then month (0-11, tm_mon convention), day of
 * month, hour, minute, second; writes carry tm_wday in the last byte.
