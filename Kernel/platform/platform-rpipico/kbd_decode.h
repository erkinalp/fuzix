// The HID keyboard decoder - ONE core, vendored BYTE-IDENTICAL in two trees:
//
//   micropython/ports/rp2/kbd_decode.{c,h}      board USB host (mp_usbh.c)
//                                               and the PC emulator (kbd_sdl.c)
//   FUZIX .../platform-rpipico/kbd_decode.{c,h} the PC3 Fuzix kernel (usbkbd.c)
//
// It is a faithful port of MMBasic's keyboard handling: layout mapping
// (keyboard_maps.h, also vendored identically), the AltGr specials, lock
// keys + LEDs, auto-repeat, and the held-key table behind KEYDOWN().
// Everything platform-specific sits behind the kbd_push/kbd_backend_*
// seam below - kbd_backend.c on MicroPython (the emulator shares it),
// usbkbd.c on Fuzix.  Do not edit one copy without the other: kbdsync.sh
// in the Fuzix platform compares the hashes.
