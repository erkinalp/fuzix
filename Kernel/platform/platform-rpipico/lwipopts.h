/*
 * lwIP configuration for the Pico Computer 3 Fuzix port.
 *
 * WHERE lwIP's MEMORY LIVES IS THE WHOLE DESIGN HERE.
 *
 * Step 0 measured the stack with everything static, in SRAM, at the
 * smallest configuration that could still work: 15,360 bytes of .bss,
 * on a kernel whose RAM region has 1,952 bytes spare.  Two thirds of
 * that was the pbuf pool and lwIP's own heap.
 *
 * So both now come out of PSRAM instead:
 *
 *   MEMP_MEM_MALLOC     every memp pool - pbufs, PCBs, TCP segments -
 *                       is allocated from lwIP's heap rather than
 *                       being its own static array.
 *   LWIP_RAM_HEAP_POINTER
 *                       that heap is pc3_lwip_heap, which net_cyw43.c
 *                       places in the PSRAM window with the SDK's
 *                       __uninitialized_psram, exactly as display.c
 *                       places the spare framebuffers.  psram.c's
 *                       psram_static_len() then keeps the PSRAM block
 *                       device and the arena allocator above it, so
 *                       nothing has to be told about it twice.
 *
 * This is safe because NO DMA EVER TOUCHES A PBUF: cyw43_lwip.c fills
 * a receive pbuf with pbuf_take (a memcpy) and transmits by copying
 * out through the driver's own SRAM buffer.  The only thing that must
 * stay in SRAM is cyw43_state, which holds those bus buffers, and it
 * is the driver's own static.
 *
 * MMBasic did NOT do this, and the reason does not transfer: its lwIP
 * heap has to stay on the C heap because the MMBasic heap is wiped by
 * InitHeap(true) on every program RUN, while lwIP holds state (the
 * netif's DHCP struct) that outlives a RUN.  A kernel arena has no
 * such event.  What MMBasic does prove is that network-path data works
 * from PSRAM at speed.
 *
 * NO_SYS: there is no RTOS under this.  lwIP runs from the kernel's
 * existing pump (plt_idle, and PendSV when a spinning process starves
 * it) exactly as tuh_task does, so the raw API is the only API and
 * sockets/netconn stay off - Fuzix has its own socket layer.

 * unlimited: these pbufs come out of the PSRAM heap that everything
 * else shares, and a program looping on a socket to itself should hit
 * flow control, not the heap.
 *
 * NO_SYS, so nothing delivers these on its own - netif_poll_all() runs

 * has a connection in TIME_WAIT - it walks tcp_tw_pcbs unless the flag
 * is set.  The board proved the consequence: a server that accepts one

 * "bind: Address already in use" with no way to override it.
