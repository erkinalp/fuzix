/*
 * mbedtls configuration for the Pico Computer 3 Fuzix port.
 *
 * TAKEN FROM MMBasic's PicoMiteWEB (net/mbedtls_config.h) and adapted,
 * rather than derived: that file is tuned for this exact chip and its
 * comments record failures that cost somebody a day each - notably the
 * record buffer size below.  The cipher and curve set is theirs
 * unchanged.
 *
 * WHAT WAS CHANGED, and why:
 *
 *  - MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_MEMORY and the CALLOC/FREE macros are GONE.
 *    MMBasic needed them because its lwIP heap was small and in SRAM,
 *    so mbedtls had to be pushed at the MMBasic heap instead.  Here the
 *    lwIP heap IS in PSRAM (lwipopts.h), and altcp_tls installs its own
 *    allocator over lwIP's heap anyway - MMBasic's own comment says so.
 *    So the right answer for this port is to let it, and to size
 *    MEM_SIZE for a session.
 *
 *  - MBEDTLS_SSL_IN_CONTENT_LEN is 16384, the RP2350 value.  MMBasic
 *    records that an undersized buffer CRASHED the firmware on a large
 *    certificate chain rather than failing gracefully - reproduced on
 *    microsoft.com at 10,738 bytes - and 16384 is the spec maximum, so
 *    no compliant server can exceed it.  It comes out of PSRAM.
 *
 *  - the time hook is ours (pc3_mbedtls_time, net_cyw43.c), reading the
 *    kernel clock.  Certificate expiry checking is only as good as that
 *    clock: this machine has a DS3231 and ntpdate, so it can be right.
 *
 * NOTE, from MMBasic and true here too: changing this file does NOT
 * rebuild mbedtls, because the -DMBEDTLS_CONFIG_FILE dependency is not
 * tracked.  Wipe the build directory or the change does nothing.

     RP2040  ->  8192 (fits the no-PSRAM 88 KB MMBasic heap).
   The #ifndef guard means that CMake -D wins; this default only applies if the
   build didn't set it. An undersized buffer previously CRASHED the firmware on
   large cert chains (any Certificate record bigger than the buffer was
   mishandled, not failed gracefully) — reproduced on microsoft.com (10738 B)
   and mail.smtp2go.com (6508 B), while amazon.com (5147 B) worked. 16384 = the
   spec maximum so no compliant server record can exceed it; 8192 still covers
   Gmail/SMTP2GO certs (~4-6.5 KB). Each KB here costs ~1 KB of MMBasic heap per
   active TLS session (MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_CALLOC_MACRO).
   IMPORTANT: changing this header alone does NOT rebuild mbedtls — the

   That call overwrites any allocator we'd install with
