# Build the SD card's Fuzix root filesystem, and the card image around it.

#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the root filesystem had no build recipe anywhere in
# the tree.  "diskimage:" in the Makefile is an empty rule, and
# PC3-DEVNOTES.md only says that filesys.img is dd'd into pc3-sd.img at
# sector 133120 - nothing built filesys.img.  mkccimage.sh layers the
# compiler onto an existing base, so the base itself was an artefact
# that could not be reproduced.  update-flash.sh IS the recipe, it was
# just wired to the 2547 block flash device; it is now parameterised and
# this drives it.
#
# FS32: the filesystem may fill the partition exactly.  The classic
# format needed 64000 of the 65536 sectors kept clear because 16-bit
# NULLBLK (65535) was a physically real sector; FS32's sentinel is
# 0xFFFFFFFF and unreachable, so that margin - and the corruption mode
# it guarded against - is gone (see FS32-FORMAT.md).
