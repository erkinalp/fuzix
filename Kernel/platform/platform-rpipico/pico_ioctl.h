 * plt_dev_ioctl (misc.c) dispatches every code in this file from a

 * that silently does the wrong thing.
 *
 * PICOIOC_BOARD was given 0x0021, which SNDIOC_PCMOPEN already had.
 * PICOIOC_BOARD is tested first, so every PCM open wrote a 2 or a 3
 * over the caller's sample rate and returned success - PLAY MP3 played
 * silence and reported nothing wrong.  The prefixes are exactly why it

 * Counting inputs - SETPIN FIN / CIN / PER (mmb2c's PLAN-count.md,
 * countpin.c here).
 *
 * These are /dev/gpio codes, NOT /dev/sys ones: they extend the GPIOC_
 * block from Kernel/include/gpio.h (0x0530-0x0536 upstream) and are
 * dispatched by devgpio.c to countpin.c.  They live here rather than in
 * the shared kernel header because the facility is this platform's, and
 * because ioctlcheck.sh reads this file - the flat space it polices is
 * /dev/sys's, but a number unique across BOTH devices is cheap and one
 * table beats two.
 *
 * The count pins are FIXED: GP4-GP7, MMBasic's INT1-INT4 in order.
 * arg is the FIN gate in ms (1..100000), the PER cycles to average
 * (1..10000), or the CIN option (1..10 - MMBasic's edge/pull table:
 * 2 falling, >=3 both edges; 1/4 pull-down, 2/5 pull-up).  READ fills
 * val with the LIVE count (CIN) or the last completed gate's latched
 * value (FIN/PER); SET stores val into the live count, CIN only, any
 * value - both exactly as MMBasic's Pin() behaves.
 *
 * The caller must hold the pin's PLK_PIN claim.  Counting is the one
 * pin mode where the kernel holds state and an interrupt, so here the
 * advisory lock is enforced, and pinlock's death-sweep is what
 * guarantees a killed program's count IRQ dies with it.
 *
 * Guarded like PC3_PINLOCK_ABI above and for the same reason: a
 * userland program includes <sys/pc3io.h> AND this file, and both
 * carry the ABI.

 * user array's physical bytes move whenever the owner sleeps or is
 * preempted - the DMA then reads whichever process's chunks landed
 * there, and a garbage duration word parks the state machine in its
 * delay loop for most of a minute.  Found the hard way: a stream that
 * was exact under a busy-poll wedged the moment its owner slept, and
 * even "passing" runs lost the few words that moved during timeslice
 * preemptions.
 *
 * So the kernel reserves ONE buffer in PSRAM at boot (the arena heap
 * never moves), sized for BITSTREAM's 10000-element cap, and this
 * ioctl - on /dev/gpio with its GPIOC_ neighbours - answers where it
 * is.  Userland copies its words in (a store; there is no MMU) and
