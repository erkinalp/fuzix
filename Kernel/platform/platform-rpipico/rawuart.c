     * Three things in that are load bearing, and we had all three
     * wrong:
     *
     *  1. `empty` is sampled BEFORE queueing.  It records whether the
     *     transmit engine might be idle, which is the only case where a
     *     kick is needed at all.  If the FIFO was full, a watermark
     *     crossing is already guaranteed.
     *  2. the wait for a full ring does NOT touch the ring.  The
     *     interrupt is the only consumer.  Ours pumped from here as
     *     well, and two consumers advancing `tail` - one of them
     *     interruptible between reading buf[tail] and storing the new
     *     tail - is how a ring gets left in a state where it is neither
     *     empty nor has room, which wedges output permanently.
     *  3. `while (irqs) {}` waits until interrupts are ON before
     *     enabling and kicking, so the kick cannot be swallowed.
     *
     * We cannot do (3) literally: tty_interrupt() echoes from inside
     * timer_tick_cb, which holds di() across the whole tick, so waiting
     * there would deadlock.  In that one case the handler's own body is
     * run inline - which keeps the single-consumer invariant, because
     * interrupts are already masked and nothing else can be in it.
