# freads and fseeks a small file, which is most of the compiler.

# The C LIBRARY first, from clean.  This script's whole reason to exist
# is "a stale .o linked against the old libc looks like a successful
# rebuild" - and then it relinked everything against a libc it never
# rebuilt.  That shipped the first FS32 card with a df whose stale
# statvfs.o kept the classic 232-byte superblock buffer: the kernel's
# 334-byte _statfs reply smashed its stack and the machine went down
# with a wild jump.  The library is not optional.
