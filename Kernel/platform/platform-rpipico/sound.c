/*
 * Pico Computer 3 sound for Fuzix: the BBC Micro sound system, PCM
 * streaming and the MMBasic synthesiser - the portable half.
 *
 * The classic model, kernel-side: channels 1-3 are square-wave tones,
 * channel 0 is an LFSR noise source; each channel has a note queue and
 * the SOUND channel-word flush/sync bits work; ENVELOPE 1-16 provides
 * the authentic three-section pitch envelope plus ADSR amplitude,
 * stepped at 100 Hz.  Pitch is the BBC scale: 4 units per semitone,
 * 89 = A4 = 440 Hz.
 *
 * Everything here works on blocks of SND_NBUF stereo 16-bit frames and
 * knows nothing about where they go.  On the PC3 that is sound_hw.c:
 * PIO I2S to the PCM5102, two chained DMA channels ping-ponging the
 * blocks, and a completion IRQ that calls sound_fill_block() for the
 * half just freed.  On a PC the device server calls the same function
 * from a sound card's callback.  sound_priv.h is the contract.
 *
 * Three sources fill a block, and the DMA does not care which: the
 * BBC synth, a PCM ring a process's decoded samples pass through (what
 * plays MP3s and WAVs - see PC3-MP3-PLAN.md), and the MMBasic PLAY
 * SOUND synthesiser.  That is the reason the output stage was worth
 * building this way rather than MMBasic's: nothing in the chain changes
 * with the source.

 * completion IRQ's whole job is feed_dma(), one block out of a ring, or
 * silence when the ring is dry.
 *
 * The ring is in PSRAM (the kernel's heap IS the PSRAM window, see
 * arena.c) because there is nowhere else: kernel SRAM has single-digit
 * kilobytes spare, and the ring wants a quarter of a megabyte.  At
 * 44100 stereo the stream is 176.4 KB/s, so 256K is about 1.5 seconds -
 * chosen against the ~25 ms a process can be swapped out for, plus SD
 * latency, rather than against the ~93 ms MMBasic and MicroPython use.
 * Neither of those has to survive being swapped out; a Fuzix process
 * does.
 *
 * Allocated on the first open and never freed.  A machine that never
 * plays anything pays nothing.
 *
 * The RING is shared but the STREAM is not: it belongs to one pid at a
 * time.  The first version left it open to anyone, and two players
 * really did interleave their samples into it - it sounded like it, and
 * whichever finished first closed the stream under the other, which
 * then got EINVAL on every write.  So open refuses a second process
 * (EBUSY) and only the owner may write or close.  A player that dies
 * without closing is not a deadlock: pcm_reap notices the pid is gone
 * and hands the state machine back.
 *
 * head and tail are free-running byte counters; used = head - tail in
 * unsigned arithmetic, which is exact across wrap and needs no spare
 * slot to tell full from empty.  Only the IRQ moves tail and only the
 * ioctl moves head, so neither needs a lock.

 * --- MMBasic PLAY SOUND synthesiser (IRQ context) ---------------------
 *
 * playsnd's 4-voice x 2-side core (utils/playsnd.c, itself MMBasic's
 * audio.c), moved INTO the DMA IRQ.  The daemon could not do the job:
 * its 186 ms PCM cushion swallowed every 20 ms pitch slide, and a
 * pool-sized program plus the daemon could not be co-resident at all -
 * every exchange swapped ~300K through the QMI, which is the noise,
 * the starved scanout and the "lockup" of 2026-08-15.  Here a
 * parameter poke is audible within one 64-frame buffer, which is
 * MMBasic's own arrangement.
 *
 * Integer only, 20.12 phase in 4096-entry-table units at 44100 Hz -
 * verbatim from playsnd, whose arithmetic was already built for a
 * machine that must not touch the FPU.  rand() is the one substitution
 * (the kernel has none): an xorshift32, seeded fixed - noise is noise.
