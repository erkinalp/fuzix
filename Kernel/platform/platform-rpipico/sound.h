 * stereo; mono is duplicated to both channels by the driver.

 * time: open, write and close all carry the caller's pid, and a second
 * process asking for it is refused rather than allowed to interleave
 * its samples with the first one's.
 *
 * open returns 0, -1 (bad arguments, or no PSRAM for the ring), or -2
 * when another process holds the stream.
 * write returns the bytes ACCEPTED, which may be less than asked for
 * when the ring is full, or -1 if the caller does not hold the stream.
 * close by anyone else is ignored.
 * stat reports the ring in bytes, and the underrun count since open;
 * anyone may ask.
