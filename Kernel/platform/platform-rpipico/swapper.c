 * WRONG LBA.  That destroys a filesystem while leaving the in-memory
 * superblock untouched, which is exactly the corruption seen here and
 * exactly why the superblock tripwire stays silent through it.
 *
 * So checksum what goes out and check what comes back.  One sum per

 * written and read in the same order, so accumulating across them costs
 * one pass over memory we are already copying.
