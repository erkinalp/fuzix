/*
 * USB host keyboard for the Pico Computer 3: TinyUSB host mode on the
 * RP2350 controller (which faces the on-board 4-port hub), HID keyboard
 * decode via kbd_decode.c (MMBasic's model, all six layouts).
 *
 * The slot/polling architecture is vendored from the MicroPython PC3
 * port (mp_usbh.c), which ported it verbatim from MMBasic - including
 * the three hard-won enumeration rules:
 *   - do NOT call tuh_hid_set_protocol at mount (wedges EP0, blocks
 *     devices enumerating behind the keyboard),
 *   - do NOT request a report from the mount callback,
 *   - reports are POLLED on a timer, never re-armed from the receive
 *     callback (re-arming broke multi-device use).
 *
 * tuh_task() is pumped from plt_idle (which overrides the weak asm
 * version in tricks.S) and from the console tty's pre-sleep hook; the
 * per-slot report timers advance from the 200 Hz kernel tick.
 * Translated bytes land in a small lock-free ring that console_getc
 * (polled by tty_interrupt) drains into the console tty - so the
 * keyboard and the serial port feed the same session.

 *
 * A Raspberry Pi keyboard (04d9:0006, no keypad) and a full-size Lenovo
 * (04b3:3025) return BYTE-IDENTICAL 65-byte report descriptors: both
 * declare the whole key usage page (19 00 2a ff 00 - an Array item
 * declares the range of values an element may carry, not which keys
 * exist), and both declare a num lock LED.  A VID:PID quirk table is no
 * better: 04d9 is Holtek, a generic controller vendor shared across
 * unrelated OEM designs, so quirking it would break a full-size Holtek
 * keyboard.
 *
 * Two rules, in this order:
 *
 *   1. A keyboard that declares NO num lock LED is taken to have no
 *      keypad - kbd_has_numlock_led in the shared decoder, and see the
 *      note there for why only that direction holds.
 *   2. Whatever was last chosen for THIS keyboard beats rule 1,
 *      remembered by VID:PID so swapping between a compact keyboard and
 *      a full-size one does the right thing each time.
 *
 * The MicroPython PC3 port has the same two rules and writes (2) to
 * /settings.json, so it survives a reboot.  A kernel does not write
 * files: here (2) lives in RAM for the session, and `picoctl numlock`
 * in /etc/rc is what makes a choice permanent.  Small and static - this
 * is read from the mount callback, which cannot allocate or wait.

 * READER about to block, and the preempt trampoline (devices.c) is gated
 * on !udata.u_insys.  A process that only WRITES reaches none of them -
 * it is always runnable, it never reads the tty, and it is inside write()
 * for almost the whole of a line, since every character is rendered to
 * the display on the way past.
 *
 * WHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE, and it is worth writing down because the shape
 * is so specific: a program streaming PRINT output could not be stopped
 * with ^C from the USB keyboard, while ^C from the serial console
 * worked.  Typing during the stream produced EXACTLY ONE character, the
 * first key pressed, and it appeared only once the program had ended.
 *
 * That is the signature of a starved pump rather than a lost signal.
 * hid_poll leaves exactly ONE report request in flight per keyboard, and
 * tuh_hid_report_received_cb - which decodes the report and is the only
 * thing that lets hid_poll re-arm ("deliberately NO re-arm") - runs only
 * from tuh_task.  So the first keypress completed its transfer in
 * hardware and sat there undelivered; every later keypress had no
 * outstanding request to complete and was lost on the wire.  The serial
 * side needs none of this: rawuart_getc is drained from the tick.
 *
 * Called per character, so the test has to be cheap: one 32-bit timer
 * load and a compare, with a real pump at most every 5ms.  The keyboard
 * is polled at 20ms (report_rate), so 5ms costs nothing in latency and
 * matches usbkbd_starved's own threshold.
