/* loadimage - draw a Windows BMP on the screen.
 *
 *   loadimage file.bmp [x [y [mode [ximage [yimage]]]]]
 *
 * MMBasic's LOAD IMAGE, as a program.  The screen has sixteen colours
 * in MODE 2 and two in MODE 1, so a photograph is quantised to the
 * nearest one - the quantiser is MMBasic's own rgb888_to_rgb121_dither
 * from BmpDecoder.c, so a colour lands on the same palette entry the
 * interpreter would pick.
 *
 * NO DITHERING.  Error diffusion needed nine arrays a raster wide -
 * three planes for the current row and two more rows for Atkinson's
 * reach - which was 18,504 bytes of bss, in a process this machine
 * loads WHILE a BASIC program is resident.  At 12 blocks of an
 * 84-block pool loadimage was a bigger neighbour than the MOD player
 * and the kernel had to refuse it (see PC3-SHARED-CODE.md); a picture
 * that will not load at all is worse than one that bands.  What is
 * left is the quantiser, which is the part that decides the colour.
 *
 * The mode argument is still accepted and parsed, because it sits
 * between y and the image offsets and dropping it would shift them,
 * but nothing acts on it.
 *
 * Formats: 1, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 32 bits, uncompressed or BI_BITFIELDS,
 * and RLE4 and RLE8.  Bottom-up and top-down.  BITMAPCOREHEADER as
 * well as BITMAPINFOHEADER, and the V4/V5 headers are read as an
 * INFOHEADER with the tail skipped, which is what they are.
 *
 * Rows are fetched by seeking rather than buffered: a BMP is stored
 * bottom-up and this draws top-down.  RLE cannot be seeked into, so it
 * gets the same treatment as the firmware gives it - one sequential
 * pass that records where each row starts, and then the rows are read
 * in the order wanted.
 *
 * Pixels reach the screen through GFXIOC_PIXELS a batch at a time,
 * with a colour for each, so a row is a handful of ioctls rather than
 * one per pixel.
 *
 * ---- SPRITE MODE -----------------------------------------------------
 *
 *   loadimage -s file.bmp [xorigin [yorigin [width [height]]]]
 *
 * is MMBasic's SPRITE LOADBMP (graphics/Sprite.c), and writes the
 * decoded sprite to STDOUT rather than to the screen, because the
 * sprite belongs to the BASIC program and this is a different process.
 * The runtime reads it down a pipe straight into the sprite's buffer
 * (mms_loadbmp in mmb_sprite.h).  Same protocol as loadpng -s:
 *
 *	uint16 w, uint16 h, little endian
 *	then w*h bytes, ONE COLOUR INDEX PER BYTE, row major
 *
 * The four optional arguments are the reference's: a window into the
 * image, defaulting to all of it from the origin given.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT DITHER, and that is not an omission.  The reference's
 * screen path quantises through rgb888_to_rgb121_dither; its SPRITE
 * LOADBMP does plain bit extraction - red's top bit, green's top two,
 * blue's top bit - and so does this.  A sprite is data that will be
 * blitted about, not a picture being fitted to the screen, and the two
 * must not be conflated: a dithered sprite moved by one pixel changes
 * colour.
