/* loadjpg - draw a JPEG on the screen.
 *
 *   loadjpg file.jpg [x [y [mode [ximage [yimage [scale]]]]]]
 *
 * MMBasic's LOAD JPG, as a program, and the same shape as loadimage:
 * the interpreter hands /usr/bin/loadjpg an argv and waits.  The
 * decoder is MMBasic's own picojpeg (third_party_mod/picojpeg.c),
 * unmodified, so a file that decodes on a PicoMite decodes here.
 *
 * WHY A PROGRAM AND NOT THE RUNTIME.  Every byte compiled into
 * mmb_*.h is a byte in every BASIC program that includes it, and the
 * decoder is 60K of source.  As a program it costs a resident BASIC
 * program nothing at all, and it is loaded only while the picture is
 * being drawn - which is also why it must be frugal: it runs WHILE a
 * BASIC program is resident in an 84-block pool.
 *
 * picojpeg decodes an MCU at a time rather than an image at a time -
 * that is the whole reason it is the right decoder here.  Nothing
 * here ever holds the whole picture, and unlike the reference it does
 * not hold an MCU ROW either: MMBasic buffers one so it can dither
 * across it, and we do not dither, so each MCU is drawn as it is
 * decoded.  That is about 30K saved on a 640-wide photo and it makes
 * the footprint independent of the picture's width.  (upng, which
 * LOAD PNG needs, cannot work this way - see loadpng.c.)
 *
 * NO DITHERING, for loadimage.c's reason: error diffusion wants two
 * rows of signed error per channel, which is thousands of bytes of a
 * pool a BASIC program is already sitting in.  The mode argument is
 * still parsed, because it is positional and the image offsets come
 * after it, but nothing acts on it.  What is left is the quantiser,
 * which is the part that decides the colour, and it is the same one
 * loadimage uses - MMBasic's rgb888_to_rgb121_dither - so a colour
 * lands on the palette entry the interpreter would pick.
 *
 * Pixels reach the screen through GFXIOC_PIXELS a batch at a time, so
 * a row is a handful of ioctls rather than one per pixel.
