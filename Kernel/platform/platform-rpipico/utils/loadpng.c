/* loadpng - draw a PNG on the screen.
 *
 *   loadpng file.png [x [y [transparent [cutoff]]]]
 *
 * MMBasic's LOAD PNG, as a program, on the same terms as loadimage and
 * loadjpg: the interpreter hands /usr/bin/loadpng an argv and waits.
 * The decoder is MMBasic's own upng (third_party_mod/upng.c) with two
 * lines changed - see upng_pc3.h.
 *
 * WHY THIS ONE NEEDS THE PSRAM ARENA.  picojpeg decodes an MCU at a
 * time; upng cannot.  PNG's filters refer to the row above and its
 * DEFLATE stream is one continuous window over the whole image, so the
 * entire picture is inflated before a pixel of it can be drawn: about
 * 307K of filtered raster and another 307K of RGBA8 for a full 320x240
 * screen, against an 84-block (336K) process pool.  That is why the
 * reference guards LOAD PNG with `#ifdef rp2350` and does not offer it
 * at all on a board without PSRAM.  Here the big blocks come out of a
 * PSRAM arena and cost the pool nothing.
 *
 * TRANSPARENCY, and one simplification the reference cannot make.
 * MMBasic composites: where alpha is below the cutoff it reads the
 * SCREEN back into a buffer, substitutes those pixels, and draws the
 * whole rectangle.  It has to, because DrawBuffer writes a rectangle
 * wholesale.  We draw pixel by pixel through GFXIOC_PIXELS, so a
 * transparent pixel is simply NOT DRAWN - the screen keeps what it had,
 * which is the same result with no readback and no second buffer.
 *
 *	transparent = -1	leave the screen showing (MMBasic's -1)
 *	transparent = 0-15	paint that palette colour (0 is the
 *				default, and MMBasic's default too)
 *	cutoff			alpha above which a pixel is opaque,
 *				1-254, default 20 as in the reference
 *
 * The colour of palette index n is the exact inverse of loadimage's
 * quantiser - RGB121, bit 3 red, bits 2-1 green, bit 0 blue - which is
 * how MMBasic's RGB121map is built (MYRTLE, 0b0010, is RGB(0,64,0)).
 *
 * ---- SPRITE MODE -----------------------------------------------------
 *
 *   loadpng -s file.png [transparent [cutoff]]
 *
 * is MMBasic's SPRITE LOADPNG, and writes the decoded sprite to STDOUT
 * rather than to the screen, because the sprite belongs to the BASIC
 * program and this is a different process.  The runtime reads it down a
 * pipe straight into the sprite's buffer (mms_loadpng in mmb_sprite.h).
 *
 *	uint16 w, uint16 h, little endian
 *	then w*h bytes, ONE COLOUR INDEX PER BYTE, row major
 *
 * One byte per pixel and not the reference's packed 4bpp, because our
 * sprite buffers are one index per byte (mms_alloc: sb->img) - the same
 * deliberate divergence the blit buffers make, recorded in mmb_blit.h.
 * Packing here would only mean unpacking at the other end.
 *
 * `transparent` carries the reference's sign trick: 0-15 is the index
 * given to pixels below the cutoff, and a NEGATIVE value means "-n is
 * the index to substitute for opaque BLACK" (so artwork whose black
 * would vanish against a black background can be remapped), with the
 * transparent index then 0.  cutoff defaults to 30 here, not 20 - the
 * reference uses a different default for the sprite form.
