/*
 * pcmplay - the half of a file player that has nothing to do with the
 * codec: the volume law, the kernel PCM sink, the drain and the signal.
 *
 * playmp3 was here first and playwav and playflac are the same program
 * with a different decoder in the middle.  Written out three times that
 * would be three copies of a volume table and a write loop, and this
 * codebase has spent a day proving what happens to anything written
 * down more than once.  One copy, included by all three.
 *
 * Static functions in a header, the way the mmb_gfx_* primitives are
 * done, so each player carries only what it names.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE: the FPU.  playmp3 must be built with hardware float
 * (minimp3 is single-precision throughout and soft float decodes at
 * 0.59x real time), and it is one of exactly two programs in the tree
 * permitted the flags, because the kernel saves no FP context across a
 * context switch and the rule is that at most one process has live FP
 * state.  WAV and FLAC are integer codecs and are built soft-float, so
 * they do not join that argument.  If a future player needs the FPU,
 * read PC3-MP3-PLAN.md before adding the flags: the invariant is held
 * by the audio device lock, and only because a player holds the PCM
 * stream for its whole life.

/* ---- memory: the PROCESS HEAP, deliberately not the PSRAM arena --------

 * out of a PSRAM arena and 5.57x out of process memory, because every
 * touch of hot decoder state was going over the QMI instead of hitting
 * SRAM.  It costs more than speed - flash and PSRAM share that
 * controller, so sustained arena traffic starves anything fetching from
 * flash, which is most of the kernel.
 *
 * Bulk data touched once belongs in the arena; a decoder's working set
 * does not.  All three players allocate from the process heap.
 *
 * onRealloc is NULL in each player's callbacks, which is what MMBasic
 * passes too: none of these three decoders needs it, and a realloc of a
 * decoder's working buffer is the last thing a 336K pool wants.
