/* playmod - the PLAY MODFILE player, and MODSAMPLE's mixer.
 *
 *   playmod file.mod [volume 0-100] [noloop]
 *
 * hxcmod (vendored via the MicroPython PC3 port, seffect extension
 * included) rendering at 22050 Hz stereo into the kernel's PCM
 * stream - the reference's modfilesamplerate, met here by running the
 * I2S at that rate rather than doubling samples.  Spawned by PLAY
 * MODFILE (mmb_play.h); PLAY MODSAMPLE arrives over the control FIFO
 * while the music plays and becomes hxcmod_playsoundeffect - one of
 * four effect slots pointed at a sample ALREADY IN THE FILE, mixed
 * into the ongoing render, music uninterrupted.  PLAY STOP is the
 * same SIGINT playmp3 catches.  With noloop the song plays once, the
 * ring drains, and exit hands the audio owner slot back - which is
 * how the BASIC side's completion interrupt sees the end.
 *
 * The FILE lives in the PSRAM arena, not the process: hxcmod plays
 * pattern and sample data in place, a .mod can be bigger than the
 * process pool wants to give, and sample reads are sequential runs -
 * the QMI-friendly placement (the MP3 plan measured the other
 * arrangements).  The WORKING SET (modcontext, the render buffer)
 * stays in the process image.  Integer only, no FPU flags.

/*
 *	How much audio to keep queued, and it MUST outlast the sleep
 *	below - which is where this was wrong.
 *
 *	usleep() rounds UP to deciseconds, because the kernel timer wheel
 *	runs once per 100ms (Library/libs/usleep.c): usleep(20000) does
 *	not sleep 20ms, it sleeps 100ms.  With 2048*4 bytes queued -
 *	92.9ms at 22050Hz stereo - this player refilled, slept PAST THE
 *	END of its own buffer, and woke to silence.  That was the ~10Hz
 *	pulsing on PETSCII Robots' title screen: about a tenth of a
 *	second of music, then about a tenth of nothing, forever.  It was
 *	never scheduling or swapping.
 *
 *	16384 bytes - 186ms - fixed the pulse with nothing else running
 *	and did NOT fix it with something else running, which is the
 *	measurement that matters: a pure-compute BASIC loop was enough to
 *	empty it.  After the 100ms sleep expires this still has to be
 *	SCHEDULED, and then render, while another process wants the
 *	processor; 86ms of margin does not cover that.
 *
 *	The players that do not pulse show what the margin should be.
 *	playmp3, playwav and playflac share pcm_write() in pcmplay.h and
 *	have NO target at all: they write until the ring refuses, which
 *	is up to the 256K the kernel holds - seconds of audio - and sleep
 *	only when it is genuinely full.  That is what "the kernel's deep
 *	ring" in playmp3's header is buying, and why an MP3 survives a
 *	busy machine that a MOD does not.
 *
 *	This does not go the whole way, because unlike a music file a MOD
 *	takes EFFECTS: queued audio plays before anything new, so the
 *	queue depth is the delay on a PLAY MODSAMPLE, and a game whose
 *	door thuds arrive a second late is worse than one that stutters.
 *	48K is 557ms - 457ms of margin after the sleep, which is five
 *	times what proved insufficient - and half a second of effect
 *	latency, which is poor but usable.
 *
 *	SO THE GUESS IS GONE.  SNDIOC_PCMWAIT sleeps in the kernel until
 *	the ring has drained to a mark, and the kernel wakes it on the
 *	TICK - 5ms, not the 100ms usleep can manage.  The queue now only
 *	has to cover 5ms of granularity instead of a decisecond of sleep
 *	plus a scheduling delay, so it can be short again, and short is
 *	exactly what a game's sound effects need.
 *
 *	8192 bytes is 92.9ms of music in hand and 92.9ms before a door
 *	thud is heard - back to where this started, but now for a reason
 *	rather than by accident, and without the dropouts, because the
 *	waiting is done by the thing that knows when the ring drains.
 *	The low mark is half of it: refill when half is gone.
