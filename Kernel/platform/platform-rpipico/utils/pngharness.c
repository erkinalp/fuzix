/* pngharness - run loadpng's own code on the host and write a PPM.
 *
 *   cc -o pngharness pngharness.c upng.c -DUPNG_NO_FILE
 *
 * NOT upng_pc3.c: this file supplies its own GetMemory,
 * FreeMemorySafe, routinechecks and error, so linking that as
 * well is a duplicate definition and the build fails.  The line
 * above used to name it and no gate runs this, so it went stale.
 *   ./pngharness test.png out.ppm [x y transparent cutoff]
 *
 * Same idea as jpgharness: loadpng is an ARM binary that talks to
 * /dev/sys, so this compiles ITS SOURCE with the system calls it makes
 * intercepted.  There are three here rather than two, because loadpng
 * also asks the kernel for a PSRAM arena - that becomes a malloc.
 *
 * What this is really for is the TRANSPARENT path.  The reference
 * composites by reading the screen back; we simply do not plot the
 * pixel.  Those are only the same thing if the pixel is genuinely left
 * alone, and a count of what was painted proves it - the screen starts
 * as a known colour and the transparent region must still hold it.
